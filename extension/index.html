		<h1>Cognitive and Learning Disabilities and WCAG</h1>
		<section id="introduction">
			<h2 id="x1-introduction"><bdi class="secno">1. </bdi>Introduction<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#introduction"></a></h2>
			<p>The following is for a first draft for adding  needs for   people with cognitive and learning disabilities into the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag20" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0">WCAG20</a></cite>]. It is based on the user research [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-user-research" title="Cognitive Accessibility User Research">coga-user-research</a></cite>]<a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/coga/user-research.html"></a> and the issue papers available at [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-issue-papers" title="Issue Papers for the The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)">coga-issue-papers</a></cite>]<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/index.html"></a>. </p>
			<p>The supporting techniques  as well as information on who it helps and why, are described in more detail in the techniques document available from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.  </p>
			<p>Detailed descriptions of users and the challenges, persona, and research sources are given in the user research document above This proposal for the WCAG  includes changes in the levels of WCAG 2.0 [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag20" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0">WCAG20</a></cite>] success criteria, new success criteria and new supportive techniques. </p>
			<p>We have identified the following themes: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Help as many users as possible understand the site and know how to use it</strong>. This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design patterns. Personalization and good use of semantics can help make the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. </li>
				<li><strong>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur.</strong> A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to render other data or start from the beginning. </li>
				<li><strong>Help the user focus and restore context if attention is lost</strong>. Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes.) </li>
				<li><strong>Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content</strong> and avoid barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content, such as hard to use security mechanisms. When possible, provide more accessible options. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Note this is a first draft. We anticipate some additions such as techniques for multi-media. However most techniques can be applied to any media, such as dividing your content into sections and using a clear heading for each section. For multi-media it should be easy to go back to each section using techniques such as indexing and bookmarks. Also note that  references to the coga techniques  may change. </p>

				      <ul>
				        <li> Capture or security mechanisms that require copying, spelling or memory skills, </li>
				        <li> Interactive communication systems, voice menu systems such as Voice XML automated customer service portals, which require the user to have a good working (transitory) memory.

A known alternative can be a WCAG technique, <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> note, or in the documentation of the platform. </p>
				      <p><b>Technique examples </b>
				        </p>
				      <p><b>Examples in security:</b> Web security and privacy technologies, for example, intentionally require users to perceive more and to do more to complete tasks. Three examples of these technologies are passwords, CAPTCHA, and 2-Factor Authentication. Such techniques require that the user has a good working memory or short term memory required to copy a code or remember complex passwords. </p>
				      <p>Alternatives exists that can allow more people to use content securely. These alternatives include using Web tokens, signing in via email account or other account, or biometrics are all alternatives to the above.

				        </p>
				      <p><b> In voice systems this may include,</b></p>
				      <ul>
				        <li>Requiring the user to understand categories,</li>
				        <li>Requiring the user to remember numbers</li>
				        
				        </ul>
				      <p>Can all be used as a barrier to getting human help. It is avoidable by having 0 as a reserved digit to access a human operator and by using best practices.

				      <p><b> In the Web of things this may include:</b>

				      <p>This is avoidable by having simple text with symbols and&nbsp;clear discoverability of how o complete each task and recoverability from errors.

								<li>Different cards have different patterns of numbers eg Amex may have more numbers than Standard Cards. Payment forms usually ask the user for the type of card. The card input form should reflect the payment card type.</li>
								<li>includes: (COGA Techniques 2.9.3 )</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Calendars and dates <ul>
								<li>Calendars should default to the first relevant day. Work calendars should default to first working day of a user's locale. </li>
								<li>The user can not enter invalid dates. If the user tries to select an invalid date it must be clear why a date can not be selected such as with a short clear and friendly error message (for example "sorry that date has passed). This avoids abandonment of the process.</li>
								<li>Calendar based booking systems must avoid ability to book return date before departure date.</li>
								<li>Terms are used that describe the present past and future days rather than just using numbers or dates. By using terminology such as today, tomorrow or travel now in the appropriate language for the locale, the user has a clear understanding of the timeliness of the event, booking or occasion.</li>
								<li>Display long form of dates with punctuation, e.g., June 1st, 2015 or 1st June, 2015. This offers a clear understanding of the date. Punctuation helps the text to speech API read the date in a way that is easier to follow.</li>
								<li>When using numbers for time - check use of appropriate punctuation between numbers when providing times as these may be read inappropriately by text to speech engines.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Temperature <ul>
								<li>Use the default temperature format of the locale. The requirement to convert between Centigrade and Fahrenheit and vice versa is burdensome so defaulting to the format of the locale removes one layer of complexity.</li>
								<li>Allow reading of long form temperature. Reading the values long form rather than using figures is helpful in for the same reasons outlined in the dates and calendar section.</li>
								<li>Reinforce with non-numerical values, e.g., Very Cold, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Very Hot. These are subjective values and may not always be helpful especially when dealing with weather and ambient temperature (due to reasons such as variances in regional average temperature - what is considered hot in UK is considered cool in India or Thailand). It may be possible to use look up tables and JSON to query relative average temperature based upon locale and adjust temperature ranges accordingly.</li>

			<p>1.3.1 Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. (Level A) </p>
			<p>The following are <b>techniques under development</b>. We can not recommend their use until they have been proven to work reliably. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Add technique to enable interoperable symbol mapping for products for Non verbal people. <p>In the Web Content: Syntax: aria-concept = "uri". Example (Pseudocode): <code>&lt;img aria-concept=http://wordnet.org/somepage#girlnode" scr="girlwithbow.gif" /&gt;</code></p>
				</li>
				<li>Add technique at a useragent symbol file end: <p><code>&lt;mysymbol scr="girlwithskirt.gif" aria-concept="http://wordnet.or g/somepage#girlnode" lang="en" /&gt;</code> Note this is not about standardizing the symbols but a way of mapping them </p>

			<ul>
				<li>1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio No Background: The audio does not contain background sounds or Turn Off: The background sounds can be turned off. </li>
				<li>We would need to change it as well to - Turn Off: The background sounds can EASILY be turned off. </li>

				<li>Note that this may need exceptions but most exceptions would still require a summary at an easier reading level. </li>
				<li>3.2.5 Change on Request: Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes. (Level AAA) </li>
				<li>3.3.6 Error Prevention (All): For Web pages that require the user to submit information, at least one of the following is true: (Level AAA) Reversible: Submissions are reversible. Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
