	<meta name="description" content="This is a set of papers that describe accessibility issues for users with various cognitive or learning disabilities. Each issue paper takes information from Cognitive Accessibility User Research [coga-user-research] and distills it into a description of the challenges for a specific user group or web usage pattern, and suggests ways to address those challenges. This information informs the Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap analysis [coga-gap-analysis] in its identification of which solutions remain unmet at this time. The set of issue papers in this publication is not comprehensive and additional ones may be added to future publications of this document."><link rel="canonical" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-issue-papers/"><style>var{position:relative;cursor:pointer}var[data-type]::after,var[data-type]::before{position:absolute;left:50%;top:-6px;opacity:0;transition:opacity .4s;pointer-events:none}var[data-type]::before{content:"";transform:translateX(-50%);border-width:4px 6px 0 6px;border-style:solid;border-color:transparent;border-top-color:#000}var[data-type]::after{content:attr(data-type);transform:translateX(-50%) translateY(-100%);background:#000;text-align:center;font-family:"Dank Mono","Fira Code",monospace;font-style:normal;padding:6px;border-radius:3px;color:#daca88;text-indent:0;font-weight:400}var[data-type]:hover::after,var[data-type]:hover::before{opacity:1}</style><script id="initialUserConfig" type="application/json">{

		<section id="abstract" class="introductory"><h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>This is a set of papers that describe accessibility issues for users with various cognitive or learning disabilities. Each issue paper takes information from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-user-research/">Cognitive Accessibility User Research</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-user-research">coga-user-research</a></cite>] and distills it into a description of the challenges for a specific user group or web usage pattern, and suggests ways to address those challenges. This information informs the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-gap-analysis/">Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap analysis</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-gap-analysis" title="Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap Analysis">coga-gap-analysis</a></cite>] in its identification of which solutions remain unmet at this time. The set of issue papers in this publication is not comprehensive and additional ones may be added to future publications of this document.</p>
			<p>This document is part of a set of related informative publications from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/">Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force</a> (COGA TF), a joint task force of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> (APA WG) and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> (AG WG) of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>What is personalization:</strong> Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the preferences or needs of the user. Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements (needs). </p>
    <p> <strong>What are user preferences</strong> are settings that identify the specifics needs of the individual user. To be effective user preferences should be standardized so that multiple applications can tailor their content to the user needs without each requiring the user to specify preferences.</p>
    <p>We need personalization because: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Different user needs can conflict. </li>
      <li> Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them. </li>
      <li> Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it. </li>
      <li> Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often be considered boring design. </li>
      <li> Ability to change levels of complexity (increase or decrease) - As the person's skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
      <li> Enable content providers to really meet the user needs. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web for people who cannot remember new symbols (such as some people with memory-related impairments like dementia. However, what is familiar for one user may be new for another. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the design and icons simple and familiar. </p>
    <p>(See Aging and Dementia [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-1" title="Cognitive Accessibility User Research; Aging and Dementia">COGA-1</a></cite>] section 3.4.15.3 ) </p>
    <p>Metadata is another related topic. Metadata allows the user to find content that they can use and suits their personal needs and preferences. A lot of work has been done to define metadata that helps people with physical disabilities find versions of content that they can use. However, the semantics and terms do not provide specific support for the requirements of people with different cognitive disabilities. </p>
   This summary pulls together a few different issue papers and addresses them together. They are: 
    <ul>
  <li> user preferences;</li>
  <li> personalization; </li>
  <li> interoperable preferences; </li>
  <li> Meta data support (to be added). </li>
</ul>
<p>Full versions can be found from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The following papers are also relevant to the delivery of personalization solutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> proposal for semantics for COGA;</li>
  <li>providing graded help; </li>
  <li> symbols for Non-Verbal.</li>

<p>Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements. Typical configurable features include color, text and icon size, sounds and mouse double click speed. More comprehensive preferences include enabling different input methods such as speech recognition or assistive technology like screen readers. Other preferences such as language or regional conventions also affect the user's interactions.</p>

          <p>People with cognitive disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to effectively use preferences to improve their experience on their own. Preference selection is often implemented by providing a range of forms with controls for enabling or choosing options for each preference. These forms can be complex in detail such audio configuration and in size given that some forms are extensive. A specific preference can be hard to locate in control panels with many options even when search and browsing are provided (e.g., Windows control Panel). As a result, some users in this group will be unable set their preferences without assistance.</p>
          <p>There are also other potential difficulties after changes to preferences are made. Changes may not be implemented immediately or further action is required for this to happen. It may also be difficult to revert to a previous setting after trailing and rejecting a particular setting.</p>

        <p>The use of custom templates of default preferences for particular groups of users is one method by which members of those groups can be immediately provided with potentially useful settings across a wide range of products and services as a starting point. The task for individual users would then be greatly reduced as they would only need to adjust those default settings that did not match their own personal preferences or needs. The ETSI work (see User Profile Management [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-1">ETSI-1</a></cite>]) suggests that organizations that represent such groups of users could develop and promote the use of such user profile templates to their client groups.</p>
          <p>Selecting  "Use typical settings" when installing a program is effectively using a template that defines a well-balanced set of preferences for a typical user. Clicking on one or more check boxes before selecting "Use typical settings" could allow one of two or three alternative templates to be applied. The [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-1">ETSI-1</a></cite>] and [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-2">ETSI-2</a></cite>] documents listed in the references describe mechanisms for creating, modifying and applying templates.</p>

        <p>Commercial services frequently use inference algorithms to infer preferences from user behavior. Such inference methods can also be of value in non-commercial personalization schemes that are solely designed to benefit the user. However, inferred preferences will always be wrong, even if they only fail to capture minor individual quirks. It is therefore important for users that they are able to correct inaccurate inferences.</p>

        <p>Another issue is that changes to settings may not take immediate effect, or if they do, it may be difficult to roll back from a setting that was tried out of curiosity but is unsuitable for the user. As a result, people with cognitive disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to select their desired preferences. Indeed, depending on the individual and the technology being used, it may be impossible without a supporter's assistance. So specific problems for people with cognitive disabilities include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>too many settings and/or options for each; </li>
          <li>not knowing what their preferences are in terms of the available technical solutions; </li>
          <li>mot being aware of possible solutions. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In fact, many of these problems effect a wide range of users, not just those with cognitive disabilities.</p>
        <p>Another issue is <strong>Contextual personalization</strong> which  includes optimizing the personalization of a product or service to  ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current context  of use. For example, settings that will suit the user of a mobile phone  in their office or home will not be well suited to that user when they  are driving a car. </p>

        <p><strong>Interoperable personalization schemes</strong>. Interoperable  personalization schemes are where users want or need products and  services to be personalized, they would prefer or need this to happen  across the widest possible range of products or services.  Personalization schemes that deliver this ideal will only succeed if  they are standardized and if that standard is adopted by the widest  range of product and service providers. However, there are many critical  issues for any personalization scheme to resolve such as funding and  adoption. </p>
       <p>Current works in progress are GPII (see [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-gpii-1">GPII-1</a></cite>] which is compatible with ISO/IEC 24751) and ETSI (see User Profile Management [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-1">ETSI-1</a></cite>], Personalization of eHealth systems by using eHealth user profiles (eHealth) [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-3">ETSI-3</a></cite>], and Personalization and User Profile Management; Architectural Framework [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-4">ETSI-4</a></cite>] ).</p></section>

    Personalization is currently addressed via many different ways such as:
    
    <ol>
      
      <li>User plug ins and software such as a text to speak enabled browsers; </li>
      <li>Web services that enable text to speech; </li>
      <li>Browser options like auto-fill (which can get it wrong and add mistakes); </li>
      <li>Add-ons, toolbars or extensions will allow the user to make Stylistic changes; </li>
      <li>Extensions like Readability will remove adverts; </li>
      <li>Text simplification; </li>
      <li>Use of the mobile web version; </li>
      <li>Safeguarding and security is currently handled by having standard safety features available for all users - or external products like parental controls (note this is also a limitation because of personalized and advertised content can be confused with standard content); </li>
      <li>Haptic feedback (see UltraHaptics: Multi-Point Mid-Air Haptic Feedback for Touch Surfaces [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-carter-1" title="UltraHaptics: Multi-Point Mid-Air Haptic Feedback for Touch Surfaces">Carter-1</a></cite>]); </li>
      <li>Live Chat help (can be intrusive and bad for ADD); </li>
      <li>Speech input like Siri or Google Glass; </li>
      <li>Widgit's Point software allows users to point to a word and get to a symbol (see Widgit Symbols [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-widgit-1" title="Widgit Symbols">Widgit-1</a></cite>];</li>
      <li>Symbol support for interoperability:
        <ol>

      <p>The above implementations do not address most what of what we need. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>None of the current implementations address all the use cases for people with learning and cognitive disabilities. For example using personalization so that a main stream website can  alternative symbol that are familure to a user or group of users.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Many users forget to use their <abbr title="Assistive Technology">AT</abbr> or browser options, and want as little complex installations as possible. There is a lack of additional help and support that is useful for Coga groups (allowing further support).</li>

        <li>Create additional semantics such as	mentioned	in	the	issue paper Proposal for Additional Page Semantics.	These semantics, as well as element names, landmarks, Indi UI and WAI-ARIA roles can be linked to user preference to enable the interface to be adapted.

For example, our recommending for WCAG [[<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/index.php?title=WCAG20">WCAG20</a>]] will be along the lines of  "Use semantics and standardized techniques that enable the content  to be adapted to the user scenario and enable additional support".</li>
          <li>Enable compatibility with standards such as GPII but do not depend on them. </li>
          <li>Develop the semantics and terms to support the specific requirements of people with different cognitive disabilities. </li>

          <li>Develop supporting techniques so authors know exactly what to do </li>

          <li> Develop Semantics for the content so that personalization  systems can know more about the content and enable adaptability of the  content </li>
          <li>Encourage development of at least  one end-to-end   solution (critical mass) that makes  it practical to develop  additional solutions that address  specific  points in the  process. </li>
          <li> Ensure any solutions architecture protects the user's privacy, such as client side adaptations and metadata that reflect functional requirements only. We also suggest an additional  issue paper on related ethics. </li>

        <p>We need standardized terms and supportive syntax that can be  linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for  the individual use, possibly via an aria attribute and personal  preferences. </p>
        <p>For example, assume an author can make it programmatically known  that a button is used to send an email. At the user end, the button  could be rendered with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that are  understandable for this particular user. It could automatically  integrate with F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms.  It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be  used for send. In addition, it could be identified as important and  always rendered, or rendered as a large button. </p>
        <p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice with user preferences are available Full versions can be found from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>. It demonstrates personalization for any use - including people with learning and memory issues </p>
        <p>It is made of 4 parts: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> JSON files for user setting; </li>
          <li>Proposal for new syntax;</li>
          <li> An <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page that uses some of the new aria syntax;</li>
          <li> Scripts that a web author can use or include that read the user settings in the JSON files and adapt the page for the user needs. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is only one example way to use the semantics. Others may follow. It is also worth noting that the GPII [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-gpii-1">GPII-1</a></cite>] and ETSI [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-1">ETSI-1</a></cite>] is working on making user preferences portable which would also enhance this work. </p>

        <p>Products for people who are non-verbal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples' language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copyright AND are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and cannot use apps or content from a different company. If we enabled mapping to open sets of symbol codes that, in turn, map to open or proprietary  symbol sets, then they can be interoperable. At the user end, the user agent can load the symbols that the user knows. Symbol sets might still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable. That means the end user could use them across different devices, or  any compatible content or applications. This is addressed further in the issue paper on symbols for people who are non-verbal.</p>

        <p>Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks. However, web security and privacy technologies intentionally introduce barriers to task completion. They require users to perceive more and to do more to complete tasks. Three examples of these technologies are passwords, <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>, and 2-Factor Authentication.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passwords are words or character strings used for authentication and/or for identity confirmation.  </li>
            <li>
                <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> is a website widget, which prevents automated programs from submitting a web form intended for humans, by requiring humans to pass a test. Such tests:
                <ul>
                    <li>present distorted text visually and/or aurally;</li>
                    <li>require users to enter that text into a field; and</li>
                    <li>require users to invoke a submit button.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                2-factor authentication requires a two-stage process to verify the identity of a user. The user is required to have two of three of the following factors:
                <ul>
                    <li>knowledge, e.g., password or <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>;</li>
                    <li>possession, e.g., mobile device or credit card;</li>
                    <li>inherence, e.g., fingerprint or voice print (via biometric device).</li>

            Challenges of security and privacy for people with cognitive disabilities
        <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#challenges-of-security-and-privacy-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities"></a></h3>
        <p>
            Web security and privacy technologies often block people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities who may not be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>discern text they are required to enter and submit;</li>
            <li>recall text or instructions they have seen or heard;</li>
            <li>follow multi-step procedures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The scope of the problem is vast because, for examples, people with disabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>are prevented from purchasing goods and registering for services on the millions of websites that employ web security and privacy technologies;</li>
            <li>may circumvent web security and privacy technologies with insecure techniques/methods;</li>
            <li>may become so frustrated working through web security and privacy technologies that they relinquish their efforts, and thereby are thwarted from purchasing goods and registering for services;</li>
            <li>may be unable to become accustomed to a web security and privacy technology because there are multiple versions of it across websites.</li>
            <li>
                may be afraid to trust a web site, thus causing them to cancel a transaction.
                <ul>
                    <li>Note: This is of particular concern for efforts to personalize web sites so they conform to users' accessibility preferences. (E.g., users may be asked whether they trust a web site in order to pass such preferences.)

                    Security tokens, some of which are hardware devices, can be used to make authentication easier. Security tokens are used instead of, or in addition to, other forms of authentication such as passwords. Security-token hardware devices:

                        <li>include key fobs, rings, or small keypads;</li>

                    Keygen, an element of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5, can be used to simplify re-authentication. After a user has completed authentication using keygen, the user will be automatically authenticated for subsequent uses of a web site or service.

            <p>Issues with working memory may affect ability to multi-task so multi-modal approach needs to be used judiciously with user choice depending on the tasks in hand and the setting.</p>
            <p>“Good cues for individuals without EMI (episodic memory impairment) can be more subtle and less central to the experience, whereas good cues for those with memory impairment  need to cover the important highlights of the experience so that they can re-learn and re-construct the forgotten experience […] Individuals with EMI are more easily cognitively overloaded, which leads to a need for systems to present a smaller number of only the most powerful cues.”</p>

        <p>Text is written communication.</p>
        <p>Textual content can be provided in a variety of alternative modes / formats as described below. Ideally, people with cognitive disabilities should be able to choose that content is delivered in the mode they comprehend best. This is an important component of the proposed <a href="http://gpii.net/">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="text-to-speech">Text-to-speech<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#ways-to-enhance-text-with-multi-modal-content"></a></h3>
        <p>Text-to-speech (<abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr>) is hardware and/or software that produces human speech by a device such as a computer. Most <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> reads text aloud in a synthesized voice. Other <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> converts symbols, such as those employed by augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), into spoken speech.</p>
        <p>Many people with cognitive disabilities, such as Dyslexia, may have the capacity to use a screen reader for <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr>. However, people with severe cognitive disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities, may require simpler <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> delivery.</p>
        <p>A common example is a <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> widget embedded in a website. An alternative is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/"> <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> speech module, as proposed by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>. Advantages include that there is nothing to download and install; and learning how to use a <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> widget or a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> speech module is dramatically simpler than learning how to use a screen reader.</p>
        <p>The <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> should be limited to relevant content, and exclude such text as found in menus, footers, and advertisements. Another helpful feature is the visual highlighting of text as it is read aloud. Such features may help people with cognitive disabilities who are overwhelmed even by simple <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> delivery.</p>
        
        <h3 id="video"> Video <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#ways-to-enhance-text-with-multi-modal-content"></a></h3>
        <p>Video is a short film clip of moving visual images with or without audio.</p>
        <p>To aid comprehension, video with audio should be captioned and/or have audio description, which provides important information not described or spoken in the main sound track. For example, see <a href="http://mindfulresearch.co.uk/2011/08/29/autistic-spectrum-captions-and-audio-description/">"Autistic spectrum, captions and audio description".</a></p>
        <p>Further, video and audio should be navigable, such as:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Having the content structured such that it is clearly identified or signposted (e.g., with a slide that says "step two - remove the old washer" or "step three - put on the new washer")</li>
            <li>The structure is navigable (e.g., a person can jump directly to step two)</li>
            <li>Keywords are identified, and can be jumped to directly</li>
            <li>Enabling bookmarks and annotations (that can be navigated)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>An image is a picture, a representation of a visual perception.</p>
        <p>User research has shown that text comprehension is significantly enhanced where accompanied by contextually-relevant images. A picture of an object may be easier to recognize than a textual description of it.</p>
        <p>Diagrams and charts as visual representations could be helpful for textual descriptions of processes or flows. Employing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/"><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Canvas, as proposed by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>, diagrams and charts could be interactive and have additional descriptions for their parts to aid comprehension.</p>

        <p>An icon is a small image or drawing that commonly represents a function. A graphic is a drawing of a visual perception or an abstract concept, or is otherwise a representation of an object or an idea.</p>
        <p>Text accompanied by consistent iconography helps convey meaning, such as by associating discrete textual passages with each other. Similarly, a pie-chart graphic may help convey meaning easier to comprehend than a table of statistics.</p>

        <p>A symbol is a sign that represents or suggests an idea, an object, an action, or a belief.</p>
        <p>Symbol sets can be used for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to support people with cognitive disabilities who have severe speech and/or language difficulties. This can include those who may understand speech, but who are unable to express what they wish to say, perhaps because of a physical disability. (It is common for people with cognitive disabilities to also have physical disabilities.) Ideally, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/symbols-non-verbal.html">interoperable symbol sets could be used to replace or to augment web-based text</a>.</p>

			<p>A distraction is something that prevents someone from concentrating on a chosen object of attention. When using the Internet distractions may draw the user's attention away from primary content, or from the current action being performed. </p>

		  <p>Drawing the user's attention away from primary content can create a range of issues depending on the user's impairment(s). If a user is consuming content and their attention is drawn away this may impact their ability to consume the primary content or complete an interaction (process).

			<p>Distraction may come from many sources. Common sources of distraction include:</p>
			<p>Overlays: Overlays partially or completely cover the primary content. This makes it impossible to see content until the overlay is removed. Reasons for using an overlay include but are not restricted to help windows, adverts, surveys, paywalls, in page notifications or animations in the site itself. Examples include, but are not restricted to:</p>
  			<ul>
				<li>Pop Ups, such as chat windows, help windows or any overlay that appears from the bottom/side/top of the screen.</li>

				<li>Pop Over, such as full screen adverts where the advert appears up over main content rather than at the bottom or sides of the page. </li>

				<li>Mouse Over activated Windows or Dialogs. Examples include help windows, chat windows, menus or other windows that are activated by a user hovering or moving a mouse over content.</li>
				<li>Delayed Overlays: Things that cover content as Overlays but do not appear until you have been on a page for some time. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Autoplaying Video/Audio: Advertisements, informational notices or a part of site content. May be in sidebars, or headers/footers or even overlaying content. In some cases advertisements may overlay a page for a period of time while the advert plays. </p>
			<p>Social Media sidebars. These often animate to draw attention, and while this is effective at drawing attention to an application they take attention away from the user action (reading. form filling etc).</p>
			<p>Adwords or similar. These are things that may look like content or links but are actually adverts inserted into the primary content. Distinction between sponsored content and primary content may not be clear to user.</p>
			<p>Sponsored content. Advertising content that is not distinguishable from primary content of page. Advertising content of similar topic injected into page may create understandability issues if not able to be removed (through closing) or in a clear and distinct color or ability to remove. Distinct information making content understandable as sponsored may not be present above the fold and therefore sponsored content keys/footnote may not be memorable if not present on page.</p>
			<p>App install prompts on mobile devices. These prompts to install an app to access an online service (website etc) rather than use a browser. </p>
			<p>Blinking or scrolling text, scrolling and changes in context and changes in content that are not expected or requested by the user can also distract people and make it hard to focus.</p>

			<p>When attention is drawn away from an action (reading, form filling etc) it breaks the user experience sequence and may result in a loss of context, place or position in the action or sequence of actions for those with impaired memory. This may cause the user to need to re-read content repeatedly, return to a previous page, or restart a sequence such as form filling. This will cause the user to need additional time to complete an action which may cause additional time out issues. </p>

			<p>This is a proposal to help people stay focused and productive. It is based on a matrix for distractions at the operating system , browser or cloud level. Currently people can turn off  distractions such as Skype, and Facebook, across different devices, and then may forget to turn them back on. This idea manages all distractions by forming a cross application and cross device distraction matrix that manages all distractions in one setting. People and users can be clustered in terms of importance or groups. For example, the CEO and your child's care giver could both be considered critical contacts. So even if they do not feel the message is urgent they can sometimes disrupt the user anyway. Some family members and important colleagues can be in another group, friends and extended family in a third group, system messages from the compliance system can be a different group again. </p>
			<p>Dimensions in the matrix can include: Groups of contacts, how urgent the contact feels any message is, and the level of interruptions the user can tolerate at any given time or setting. The user can set how to handle any combination of the above for the level of concentration needed at the time. For example, during normal work hours, messages from important colleagues could interrupt the user, but any other messages would get logged and read when the user has time. In another example the user may be  giving a talk and sets the interruption level to critical. Then, only critical messages from key colleagues and family can interrupt. IE: Messages that a critical contact feels is critical and urgent. Default systems can include setting work hours. Optionally, distractions such as news websites could also be limited in low distraction times. </p>
			<p>Further pop-ups and similar distractions must be always consistently easy to close and avoid so that all people can continue their task.</p>

            <p>Voice systems are systems that a user interacts with by listening to spoken prompts from an automated system. 
                The user responds by either
                pressing keys on a telephone keypad or by speaking (or both). 
                Voice systems are widespread in telephone self-service applications for customer support. 
            </p>
            <p> It is worth noting that many crucial systems are dependent on this technology such as emergency notification, 
                healthcare appointment reminders or prescription refilling, and others. 
                Therefore full accessibility needs to be supported.</p>

            Voice systems are often implemented with the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> VoiceXML standard and supporting standards from the 
            Voice Browser Working Group.
            <p>See [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-voicexml20">voicexml20</a></cite>] and [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-voicexml21">voicexml21</a></cite>]
            </p>
            <p>However, it is important to emphasize that issues of cognitive accessibility for voice systems
                apply without regard to whether
                a voice system is implemented using the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> voice standards or with a proprietary technology.It is impossible
                for a user to tell what technologies are used in the underlying voice platform, but the usability 
                principles will be the same whatever the underlying technology is.</p>
            <p>An example use case may be as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user may be asked "For sports press 1, For weather press 2, 
                    For Stargazer astrophysics press 3." The system then waits for a response.</li>
                <li> Accessibility is discussed for the hard of hearing, and 
                    WCAG and WAI specification are cited as being relevant 
                    (see [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-voicexml2.0#accessibility">VoiceXML2.0#accessibility</a></cite>])
                    Beyond that, no examples or concerns are identified for cognitive accessibility.</li>

                <p>A good working memory is essential for using menu-based systems that present several choices
                    to the user and ask them to select one choice, whether by speaking or through a key presss. 
                    The user needs hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind 
                    such as the number that is being presented as an option, whilst processing the terms that follow.</p>
                <p>A good short term memory (several seconds) is essential so that the user can remember the 
                    number or the term.</p>
                <p>Without these functions the user is likely to select the wrong number.</p>

                <p>Limitations of executive function may also cause problems 
                    when the system response is too slow. The user may not know whether their input has 
                    registered with the system, and consequently may press the key or speak again.

                    needs to be able to speak a word or short phrase. However, some systems ("natural language systems") allow the
                    user to describe their issue in detail. While this feature is an advantage for some users because it
                    does not require them to remember menu options, it can be problematic for users with disorders like
                    aphasia who have difficulty speaking.

                <li> For users who are unable to use the automated system, it must be possible to reach a human, either in a call
                    center or another operator, through an easy transfer process (that is, not by being directed
                    to call another phone number).
                </li>
                <li>There should be a reserved digit for requesting a human operator. 
                    The most common digit used for this
                    purpose is "0"; however, if another digit is already in widespread use in a particular country, then
                    that digit should always be available to get to a human agent. Systems especially should not attempt
                    to make it difficult for users to reach an agent through the use of complex digit combinations.
                    This could be enforced by requiring implementations to not allow the reserved digit
                    to mean anything other than going to an operator. </li>
                <li>Other digits similarly could be used for specific reserved functions, keeping in mind that too many
                    reserved digits will be confusing and difficult to learn. Remembering more than one or two reserved digits may be problematic for some users, but repeated verbal recitals of the reserved digits will also be distracting.

            User-specific settings can be used to customize the voice user interface, keeping in mind that 
            the available mechanisms for 
            invoking user-specific settings are minimal in a voice interface (speech or DTMF tones). If it is difficult to set user
            preferences, they won't be used. Setting preferences by natural language is the most natural ("slow down!") but is not currently very common.
            <ol>
                <li>Extra time should be a user setting for both the speed of speech and ability for the user 
                    to define if they need a slower speech or more input time etc. </li>
                <li>Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).</li>
                <li>The user should be able to extend or disable time out as a system default on their device </li>
                <li>Error recovery should be simple, and take you to a human operator. Error response should not though the user off the line or send them to a more complex menu. Preferably they should use a reserved digit. </li>

            Standard best practices in voice user interface apply to users with cognitive disabilities, and should be followed.
            A good reference is published by The Association for 
            Voice Interaction Design Wiki [AVIxD].
            Another good reference is [ETSI ETR 096].
            Some examples of generally accepted best practices in voice user interface design:
            <ol>
                <li>Pauses are important between phrases in order to allow processing time of language and options. </li>
                <li>Options in text should be given before the digit to select, or the instruction to 
                    select that option. This will mean that the user does not need to remember the 
                    digit or instruction whilst processing the term. For example: The 
                    prompt "<em>press 1 for the the secretary,"</em> 
                    requires the user to remember the digit 1 while interpreting the term "secretary". 
                    A better prompt is "<em>for the secretary (pause): press 1"</em> or " <em>for the secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1</em>"</li>
                <li>Error recovery should be simple, and take the user to a human operator if the error persists.
                    Error responses should not end the call or send the user to a more complex menu. 
                </li>
                <li>Advertisements and other extraneous information should not be read as it can confuse the 
                    user and can make it harder to retain attention.</li>
                <li>Terms used should be as simple and jargon-free as possible.</li>
                <li>Tapered prompts should be used to increase the level of prompt detail when the 
                    user does not respond as expected.
                </li>
            </ol>

                    exists and should be used where possible [ETSI 202 076],
                    keeping in mind that expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a burden on the user.</li>
                <li>Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their
                    requests in their own words, and can be useful for users who have difficulty 
                    remembering menu options, or who have difficulty mapping the offered menu options to
                    their goals. However, natural language interfaces can be difficult to 
                    use for users who have difficulty 
                    producing speech or language. Directed dialog (menu-based) fallback or 
                    transfer to an agent 
                    should be provided.</li>

            <h3 id="follow-requirements-of-legislation">Follow requirements of legislation<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#proposed-solutions-1"></a></h3>
            For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255 Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input, control, and mechanical functions, clauses 
            (g), (h) and (i) apply to cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable without time-dependent controls, the ability to
            speak, and should be operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.

            Recent developments in call center technology may be helpful for users with cognitive disabilities.
            <ol>
                <li>Visual IVR. When a call comes in on a smartphone, the system can ask the user if they want to 
                    switch over to a visual interface which mirrors the voice interface. This allows a user to see the prompts
                    instead of having to remember them.</li>
                <li>Adaptive voice interface. This is a technology that is sensitive to the user's behavior and changes the voice interface dynamically. 
                    For example, it can slow down or speed up to match the user's speech rate [Adaptive].
                </li>
                <li>Tapered prompts. Best practices in  voice user interface design include providing several different prompts for each point in the interaction. The different prompts are used based on the user's behavior. For example, if the user takes a long time to respond to a prompt, a simpler or more explanatory version of the prompt by be used instead of the default.</li>
                <li>Human assistance. Although the user interacts normally with the voice system, in case 
                    the system is unable to process the user's speech, a human agent acts behind the scenes to 
                    perform the necessary processing. This would allow users with a limited ability to speak (whose speech might
                    not be recognized by a speech recognizer) to 
                    interact with the system. </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="status-of-these-solutions">Status of these solutions<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#proposed-solutions-1"></a></h3>
            <p>Note. The above proposed solutions have been tested for users in the general population and have
                been shown to improve the usability of voice systems, although the extent to which they have been tested with users with cognitive disabilities is not clear.

			<h3 id="x8-1-introduction"><bdi class="secno">8.1 </bdi>Introduction<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#introduction-4"></a></h3>
			<p>Online payment systems collect information necessary to enable electronic money movements used for but not limited to the purposes of e-commerce purchases, bill payments, person-to-person payments, transferring funds between account holder accounts, and wire transfers. The typical source of funds includes demand deposit accounts (also known as debit accounts) such as a checking or savings account, or a credit account such as a credit card or home equity line of credit. These systems function as a fast and secure electronic alternative to traditional money movement or payment methods such as checks and money orders. </p>
			<p>Providers of online payment systems include financial institutions, e-commerce vendors, billers such as utility companies, government agencies, and online payment companies like PayPal, Official Payments, or Visa. A secure online account may or may not be required to use these systems. In addition to functionality, online payment systems provide access to transactions, and in some cases bills as well. </p>
			<p>The terms "online payments", "web payments", "online bill payments", and "online transfers" all involve use of a web-based or mobile app interface for the purpose of consumer to business, person to person, or account to account money movements. Although some differences exist, the learning and cognitive disability challenges presented by all of these payment systems are very similar. Therefor, the terms are used synonymously in this paper.</p>
			<p>Online payments provide opportunities for people with disabilities to live more independently, however interfaces poorly designed or not designed at all for learning and cognitive disabilities can lead to errant payments and the possibility of significant personal financial hardships. Full accessibility is a necessary part of the solution to prevent unintended, potentially financially burdensome consequences associated with using online payments.</p>

			<h3 id="x8-3-challenges-of-web-payments-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities"><bdi class="secno">8.3 </bdi>Challenges of web payments for people with cognitive disabilities<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#challenges-of-web-payments-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities"></a></h3>
			<p>While the use of computer technologies could be effective in helping individuals with cognitive disabilities make online payments, the diversity of ability, conditions, and experience of users with cognitive disabilities can create problems in many online payment situations. The sheer number of different types of cognitive disabilities and effects that they can have on users adds to an already complex issue. </p>
			<p>Designing accessible web payment systems for users with cognitive disabilities can present some interesting challenges. Certain individuals may have trouble processing language and numbers, deciphering auditory input, and with comprehending spatial orientation. To understand material regarding web payments, a person must be able to identify information and integrate it into meaningful “pieces” or “components”. A person with a brain injury (or other cognitive impairments) may take longer to think and respond to online stimuli. In a web payment system, multiple windows as well as complex or cluttered displays can create distractions and cognitive processing problems. Extended sequential operations can be likewise distracting to those with memory deficit problems. The use of right and left click buttons on a mouse can create difficulties for users with memory, perception or reflex problems. </p>
			<p>Individuals with lower literacy may have different reading patterns than high literacy readers when it comes to understanding web payment material; while high literacy readers scan text, people with low literacy may read the text “word for word”. This reading style can create a narrow field of view. Objects and information essential for successfully completing online payments may be missed when they are not directly in the flow of text a person is reading.</p>
			<p>Effect of Memory Impairments: Individuals with working memory issues and short term/long term memory issues can have difficulty with navigation and interacting with the basic functionality of an online payment system. They may have trouble remembering information such as a street address or Zip Code, forget to enter required information, or not know where to go next. </p>
			<p>Effect of impaired executive function: Individuals with emotional control/self-monitoring issues, task flexibility limitations, planning/organization/execution difficulties, and impaired judgment may find it hard to progress properly through a myriad of tasks in web payments. They may become easily frustrated or give up. </p>
			<p>Effect of impaired reasoning: Those having issues with fluid reasoning, mathematical intelligence limitations, seriation/behavioral/comprehension knowledge, and abstraction difficulties may find it hard to recognize patterns and compute numbers in web payment systems. </p>
			<p>Effect of attention-related limitations: Persons with selective attention/divided attention issues may have difficulty separating out the important aspects from the irrelevant ones in a web payment transaction. Persons with a limit on sustained attention may not be able to successfully complete all the steps in a web payment transaction. </p>
			<p>Effect of impaired language related functions: Individuals with speech perception or speech issues may not be able to recognize or respond intelligently to spoken commands in a web payments system. Those with literacy difficulties may not be able to properly read the instructions for a web payments system, and thus not know what to do. </p>
			<p>Effect of impaired literacy related functions: With difficulties in speech perception and/or visual perception, individuals may not be able to read or understand written or spoken commands regarding web payment information. Issues with phoneme processing may make it hard to properly process auditory cues, and cross-model association difficulties may hinder associations of symbols with meanings in a web payment transaction. </p>
			<p>Effect of perception-processing limitations: Visual perception (e.g., object recognition, pattern recognition) issues for certain persons may make it difficult to properly perceive the relative locations and meanings of symbols related to web payment. In addition, auditory/speech, motor, and/or tactile perception limitations may hinder use of web payment systems displayed via those modalities. </p>
			<p>Effect of reduced knowledge: People with grammar, metaphorical, and/or lexical knowledge limitations could find it hard to interact correctly with web payment systems using those capabilities to provide critical information for understanding the process. Issues in cultural knowledge and base language knowledge (including the use of jargon, idioms, icons, etc.) may also figure into making a web payment properly as intended. </p>
			<p>Effect of impaired understanding of behaviors or consciousness: Improper understanding of behavioral norms, social cues, that may be important in successfully completing a web payment may introduce difficulties for certain persons. </p>

			<p>It is important in any proposed solutions to make operational tasks (interacting with a web payment system) as transparent as possible in order for people to focus their attentions on the content related functional aspects of the process. The following solutions support general usability of online payment systems for everyone, in addition to assisting those with cognitive disabilities. </p>
			<section id="navigation">
				<h4 id="x8-4-1-navigation"><bdi class="secno">8.4.1 </bdi>Navigation<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#navigation"></a></h4>
				<ul>
					<li> Since improper or ambiguous navigation and labeling can create confusion, it is important to standardize controls, features, and navigation within a web payment system – consistency will greatly aid users with short-term memory difficulties. </li>
					<li> It is important whenever possible to keep menus short and easy to understand, and to use clear labels and signs. </li>
					<li> It is essential to provide ways to backtrack or start over in navigation. For example, the use of breadcrumbs can help to provide confirmation of navigation and reinforce objectives. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to provide site-maps for larger online payment systems, such as those used for bill payments. </li>
					<li> It is essential to provide prompts and feedback to let users know if they made the correct choice and to help them get back on track when they encounter an error. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to increase the size of "clickable" areas to aid persons who have visual processing or mobility challenges. </li>
					<li> In a web payment system, it is important to limit the number of options to prevent cognitive overload, and to offer a shallow or narrow decision structure. </li>
					<li> A web payment system should be designed so as to avoid the need for simultaneous tasks. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id="functionality">
				<h4 id="x8-4-2-functionality"><bdi class="secno">8.4.2 </bdi>Functionality<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#functionality"></a></h4>
				<p>It is desirable to allow the user control of as many aspects of the web payment system as possible. For example, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used to provide control of how information is presented. A user interface component can be used to change the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> definitions for font and font size; change the line height or space between lines of text; increase the size of "clickable" areas; allow for mouse over highlighting of text for easier reading; change the background color of a page; and invert colors and increase contrast on the page. This approach can allow a designer to maintain higher level control over design families while allowing a person to control the presentation to suit their individual needs. </p>
				<ul>
					<li> It is desirable to provide external lists for complex operations for those with memory problems. </li>
					<li> It is important to identify pre-knowledge necessary for a user to successfully utilize a web payment system. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to provide definitions and explanations for unusual or technical terms presented in a web payment system (for example, by utilizing the ABBR and ACRONYM tags in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> as appropriate). </li>
					<li> In a web payment system, it should be ensured that alerts and feedback remain on a screen until a user explicitly removes them. </li>
					<li> It is important to optimize search facilities, and to include tolerance for misspellings and typos. </li>
					<li> It is essential to ensure that web payment systems are compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies. </li>
					<li> In a web payment system, it is important to include speaking text/narration for users with low-literacy or processing impairments </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id="content-and-text">
				<h4 id="x8-4-3-content-and-text"><bdi class="secno">8.4.3 </bdi>Content and text<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#content-and-text"></a></h4>
				<p>Proposed solutions should address the three categories of human perception: </p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Active</dt>
						<dd>Conditioned by a person's knowledge and expectations</dd>
						<dt>Patterned</dt>
						<dd>As the brain attempts to organize information into meaningful patterns</dd>
						<dt>Selective</dt>
						<dd>Picking out the information that stands out to the learner</dd>
					</dl>
				<p>In particular, </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Since complex text can create difficulties for users with cognitive impairments, appropriate graphics should be used to help reduce cognitive load and enhance understanding. </li>
					<li> It is important to use plain language in short, concise sentences (keep it simple) in a web payment system. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to reiterate information for users with memory problems. </li>
					<li> A technique may be to use the “newspaper style of writing” – start with a summary then provide the material in an order from most important to least important. It is important to avoid lengthy text or audio, and to prioritize information to ensure that all critical material is at the top half of the page or"above the fold", as well as to avoid the need for scrolling to complete the payment task(s) on a screen, if possible. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to "chunk" materials in a web payment system – one idea per paragraph. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to use bulleted lists whenever possible. </li>
					<li> It is important to use meaningful headings. </li>
					<li> In a web payment system, line length should ideally not exceed 70-80 characters. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to include plenty of white space on the page while not creating "rivers of white" caused by full justification. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to avoid or provide alternatives for non-literal text and colloquialisms in a web payment system. </li>
					<li> It is good to offer individuals a choice of "long" or "short" content so they can determine and control the level of detail they require when interacting with a web payment system. </li>
					<li> It may be good to design for working memory limitations (2; 1), and to reduce the standard 7 ± 2 maximum elements guideline for short-term memory to 4 ± 2. </li>
					<li> A possible technique is to allow the use of unexpected events to possibly help a person retain information. </li>
					<li> A possible technique is to investigate the use of readability tests, while not all-inclusive, readability tests can provide assistance in maintaining an appropriate level of simplicity for text. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id="layout">
				<h4 id="x8-4-4-layout"><bdi class="secno">8.4.4 </bdi>Layout<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#layout"></a></h4>
				<p>Making a web payment system visually interesting and easy to read can make "listening" to that system difficult (due to the use of graphical spacers and tables, which can disrupt the reading order of related text). The use of database driven text and Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) can create web payment systems that satisfy the needs of both visual and aural users, while still making it easy to change information and textual data. Additionally, style sheets help to convey context, allow for graceful degradation, and make it available for a greater number of possible browsers to read the code properly. </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Consistency is a design goal for most web payment systems. All of the pages in a web payment system should remain as consistent as possible. It is important to ensure that material is well organized on all pages of a web payment system. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to streamline page design in a web payment system. </li>
					<li> It is beneficial to highlight urgent or key information in a web payment system. For example, color, highlighting, and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or ARIA semantics can be used to aid in selective perception. </li>
					<li> In web payment system design, it is good to avoid using menus or other text that appears and disappears when the mouse moves over it, and to avoid the use of text that moves or changes. </li>
					<li> It is extremely desirable to use high contrast between text and background. </li>
					<li> Reducing clutter and extra material in a web payment system can improve usability and accessibility for those with visual and cognitive disabilities. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id="multimedia">
				<h4 id="x8-4-5-multimedia"><bdi class="secno">8.4.5 </bdi>Multimedia<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#multimedia"></a></h4>
				<p>Access techniques (where necessary) involving using multimedia for interacting with web payment systems should include (at a minimum): captioning, audio description, subtitling, and dubbing. However, a variety of new options for multimedia on the internet have presented themselves. </p>
				<ul>
					<li> It is desirable, since sound and vision may be "complementary modes of information", to use accompanying sounds to help cue a user as to what to do or to enhance a point. It is also desirable to use audio prompts to signal any change of state. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to present online payment materials in multiple modes, such as including captions to audio and screen readers to enhance text; this can help increase comprehension. It is essential to provide alternate formats for material so that users can choose the format that best suits their needs </li>
					<li> It may be important in a web payments systems to use fully accessible graphics and recognizable icons as navigation aids. </li>
					<li> The use of appropriate and clear graphics can help to enhance understanding of materials on a web payments site. However, it is important to not overuse graphics and to avoid animated graphics, as they can be distracting and increase cognitive load. If animations or dynamic displays are being used, it is desirable to include controls that allow a user to adjust the speed and motion. </li>
					<li> It is desirable to use familiar imagery to aid in memory retention, since there may be a lot of steps involved in progressing through a web payments system. </li>

		<p>The Internet is not always a safe place. Like life off the Internet, everyone is at risk of having crime being a part of their experience online. Usually referred to as cybercrime these activities, including fraud, terrorism, extortion, harassment and hacking are perpetrated by several types of criminals:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hackers may steal someone’s identity, information or money without the user being aware of what is happening.</li>
			<li>Con-artists or cheats mislead people into giving them information or sometimes money.</li>
			<li>Sexual predators use the Internet to identify vulnerable people and exploit them, either online or offline.</li>

				<p>People with cognitive disabilities may not be able to easily use some of the common security measures used on the Web such as two-factor authentication and safe and unique passwords.</p>

<p>Extra security precautions to increase password strength often make this group more vulnerable to "human error". This can encourage risky behaviour such as keeping a list of passwords on a desk which can be used by anyone who has physical access to the room. Also, when users ask for assistance to complete these security procedures, they can put themselves at high risk of being abused by those they trust to help.</p>

				<p>These cyber-criminals use deception to gain trust and this enables them to negatively influence the behavior of vulnerable individuals. People with cognitive impairment who experience difficulty understanding social cues will likely fail to accurately identify a risky or potentially harmful situation. Those who have difficulty understanding others can act contrary to their own hypothetical actions in a given situation  (i.e., mind-blindness) are more trusting and may easily believe false information. Also, people with impaired reasoning, attention or memory may be similarly vulnerable to these situations as they are not especially cognitively equipped to validate presented information.</p>

				<p>People with cognitive disabilities may be more at risk of being a victim of a sexual crime. This is more likely if: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> they tend to be unaware of someone using a fake identity or misleading information; </li>
					<li> they are dependent on care givers and family who they are afraid of disappointing, which makes them susceptible to blackmail; </li>
					<li> they tend to believe false information and find it harder to validate facts; </li>
					<li> they are less likely to identify unreasonable requests. </li>

				<p> Personalization is important, especially as a way to avoid conflict when meeting varying user needs, among many other reasons. However, there is a significant risk that if poorly implemented, user information and vulnerabilities can be exposed. This puts the most vulnerable users of this population at the greatest risk. </p>

			<p>Safety should be priority when making content accessibile for people with cognitive disabilities extra care should be applied at the same time to keep them safe. </p>
			<p>All user information must be kept safe, to the fullest extent possible. Any clues that the user has cognitive disabilities, such as a request for a simplified version, should be protected information. </p>
			<p>Personalization systems should be designed so that any information implying vulnerabilities are on the user device and are secure. Use of functional requirements can also be a safer alternative to describing user needs in systems such as meta-data.</p>

        <p>Voice Output Communication Aids (VOCAs) are devices that have been developed to allow pictures, symbols or words to be used with speech synthesis. The devices may be specialist items with built in systems carrying the symbols. They may also be a generic computer, tablet or mobile with specialist software or apps. The symbols are activated by single or multiple touches, eyes dwelling on a chosen image or manual use of a keyboard or switches. An external input device usually allows for step by step scanning up and down rows and columns of symbols on a grid. Symbols and word choices are personalised to suit the user, representing known objects, actions and happenings.</p>

        <p>The users of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) based on images or pictographs as symbols tend to have no speech or language, very unintelligible speech or difficulties expressing themselves and/or may need reading support. Individuals may also have severe mobility and dexterity disabilities and/or cognitive impairments. Depending on the skills of the user, the environment and task in hand, symbols may be used to represent a phrase or whole sentence of speech or be made up of individual parts of speech to aid sentence making. Where literacy skills are a challenge the use of online communication becomes an issue due to the lack of accurate symbol to text or text to symbol sets that can be used/translate across all symbol systems.</p>

                <p>The strategy of mapping symbol sets to a common vocabulary may allow developers to incorporate helpful symbols knowing these can be automatically presented to the user in their own symbol language. This schema would also allow symbol users to use their own symbols in an edit box or form knowing it can be recognised by other symbol users with the automatic translation. The primary solutions for the mapping symbols for symbol users could be divided into three different user scenarios. For all these scenarios, the symbols presented to the symbol users could be alternative and adaptive based on the users' preference.</p>

                <p> One option for interoperable symbol mapping uses the proposed syntax: aria-concept = "uri" to reference target concept URI like the following example. </p>
                <div class="example">
                    &lt;img aria-concept="http://wordnet.org/somepage#girlnode" src="girlwithbow.gif"/&gt;</div>
                <p>
                    This aria-concept syntax could take advantage of the Concept Coding Framework (CCF). Due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises, it is difficult to reference to and exchange symbols as an alternative or complement character based texts. Therefore, the CCF provides a common framework to link and map these symbols (currently Blissymbolics and ARASAAC symbols, and eventually other alternative representations) based on the concept coding. For example, the presentation of cat symbol (concept coding: cc-cat-1001) in this scenario would be as follows: for the cat concept: cc-cat-1001, there are different symbols to represent this concept across different symbols providers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If user prefer ARASSC symbols:

                <p>In order to map the symbols from different dictionaries, one of the approaches could be the use of an ontology and Semantic Web technologies to enable interoperability of symbols datasets.</p>
                <p> An ontology is a formal specification of a shared conceptualization. In Semantic Web, a vocabulary can be considered as a special form of (usually light-weight) ontology, or sometimes also merely as a collection of URIs with a (usually informally) described meaning. Linked Data is a term used to describe a recommended best practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces of data, information, and knowledge on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF (The Resource Description Framework, <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommend metadata data model). The Concept Encoding Framework Working Group provides the multilingual and multi-modal lexical ontology (The Lexicon Model for Ontologies  of the CCF to be made available in a Linked Open Data (LOD) format. It also allows users to search symbols based on different concepts and metadata, such as language, symbol datasets, localization. The following example demonstrates using the RDFa to represent the mapping between symbols based on concept coding.

                <p>This approach mainly requires the symbol dataseat providers to publish the symbols and their concepts as "Linked Open Data". As one of four principles in Linked Data, the URI naming for the concepts could provide the target concept link described in the first solution. It could also provide the alternative same concept symbols based on preferred properties, such as localization, language and colour etc.</p>

Where numbers look or sound similar these may cause confusion for example, 7 and 9 or 66 and 56 – may be based upon the language and where numbers are read out with no visual cue or may be written with no audio support. </p>
				<p>An alternative presentation of numbers may cause problems, so the difference between the calculator keypad, the numbers on a keyboard and a phone pad may result in incorrect numbers being used to unlock or access product services. Cognitive load associated with decoding numbers and symbols should be considered when offering alternative strategies. These alternatives could further exacerbate executive functioning difficulties, for example saying ‘1/5’ as ‘open fraction one over 5 close fraction’ compared to saying ‘one fifth’ – this is to do with the amount said or verbosity. </p>

				<p>If there is an impairment of abstract thinking and reasoning, problem solving and working online with numbers in any way will be impacted upon to such an extent that users will be unable to access arithmetical content, use numerical passwords or cope with decision making based on numerical information such as entering vehicle registration numbers where L and O many be confused with 1 and 0 (one and zero), particularly when using lower case. </p>
				<p>Items that need to be added to an edit form in a particular manner such as zip codes or postal codes, dates, time, birthdates etc. may also cause confusion. </p>

				<p>Attention limitations may cause problems with completing items accurately where there are a required number of steps or where midway between two processes concentration has been lost due to another distraction e.g. adverts, pop-up, interstitials etc. This issue is linked to memory difficulties and being unable to cope with versioning – noticing the different file names where numbers have been used and not a complete change of title. </p>

				<p>Receptive and expressive speech and language impairments may hamper the ability to cope with numbers provided auditorily such audio <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>. Cultural differences in the way numbers and math are spoken may cause issues around the order of presentation and the words used such as parentheses (US) or brackets (UK). </p>
				<p>The inclusion or exclusion of certain elements of an equation when read aloud can have an impact on understanding, for example, leaving out parentheses or brackets. </p>
				<p>Different voices used by text to speech engines read numbers in different ways for, example, phone numbers may be read incorrectly. </p>

				<p>This includes, difficulties with reading the symbols representing numbers and numerical concepts which can cause confusion, increased time taken when completing forms and the misreading of sums. This could be considered as a decoding issue. An example would be ‘50%’ failing to be understood as ‘fifty percent’. </p>

				<p>There are several perceptual difficulties that may impact on numerical ability such sequential processing where comprehension of multiple numerical items in a process may be impacted upon such as addition and subtraction where the order of numbers is crucial. Sequencing difficulties also impact on time and the duration of time or even size of numbers. Auditory perceptual difficulties occur where numbers may appear to be misheard but actually hearing can be good and it is the comprehension that is affected so the number or numerical concept does mean anything. For example the audio <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> is read out aloud but in the time given the user is unable to process the content. </p>
				<p>Visual perceptual difficulties may include spatial and pattern recognition where the user may have problems with diagrammatic representations of numerical and symbolic information. For example extracting information from a graph or diagram, comparing diagrammatic information or where position impacts on the concept – ¾ compared to 4/3.</p>

				<p>Reduced knowledge may occur where an individual has sustained a brain injury and prior understanding of numbers and numerical concepts have been lost. This may result in all the aforementioned issues occurring. </p>

				<p>The abstract nature of numerical information may be impacted on by a lack of understanding the presentation of problems that are inappropriate to the concept of the user’s environment and lifestyle – this may include items such as examples that are given as comparisons such as weighing as much as an elephant – the user is not talking about elephants but making a comparison between heavy and light. </p>
