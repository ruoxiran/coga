			<p>This document is to help us gather techniques and strategies as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
			<p>Larger scale, engineering solutions can also be added to the issue papers.</p>
            
            <p>Editors Note: We intend to add more  examples to each technique and provide some example pages </p>

			  <h3 id="x1-1-summary"><bdi class="secno">1.1 </bdi>Summary <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#summary"></a></h3>
			  <p>Most designers want people to be able to use their site. However designs that might be difficult for some people to use can actually bar people with cognitive and learning disabilities from using the content at all. Typically this happens because content providers may not be familiar with the needs of different people. </p>
			  <p>This document contains detailed techniques that should enable content to be usable by people with cognitive and learning disabilities. </p>
			  <p>We have identified the following <strong>themes</strong> though the techniques.</p>
			  <ol>
			    <li><strong>Help as many users as possible understand the site and  know how to use it.</strong> This often involves using things that are clear and familiar   to the user so that they do not have  to learn new symbols, terms or design patters. <strong>Personalization </strong>and good use of semantics can help make the  symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible.</li>
			    <li><strong>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes</strong> when they do occur. A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to renter other data or start from the beginning.</li>
			    <li><strong>Help the use focus and   to restore context if attention is lost</strong>.  Items like  breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes)</li>
		      </ol>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>Main techniques include:</p>

			<section id="document-structure"><h3 id="x1-2-document-structure"><bdi class="secno">1.2 </bdi>Document structure<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#document-structure"></a></h3> The top level headings are who the techniques and strategies are for, such as general techniques that help most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, techniques that help for attention, techniques that help people with difficulty processing language etc. The sections are based on function and not disability names. <p></p>
			<p>The document is the divided into topics (such as E<em>mphasis Structure</em>) at heading level 3, and then into individual techniques at heading level 4. Each topic also has a "see also" section where you can put WCAG mappings. Where appropriate the techniques can labeled for localization. </p>
			<p>Each technique is divided into: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explanation and who it helps,</li>
				
			  <li> Pass examples, (if needed) </li>
				<li>Failure examples,(if needed) and </li>
				<li>Sources/research. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tags are for who it helps ("use for" tags) and for who can detriment ("avoid for" tags) from use of this strategy. The default is that a strategy is good for all groups.</p>
			<p>Tags can be for the cognitive function impairments or other user descriptors such as localization.</p>
			<p> For example </p>
			<p><strong>Use for:</strong> "Short Term Memory" would imply that this strategy is helpful for people with a short term memory impairment.</p>
			<p>Tags can be concatenated. For example: "Short Term Memory-Visual Memory". Additional terms are limiting, and the tag becomes more specific as we concatenate terms.</p>
			<p>Tags for cognitive function are found in the Cognitive Function Table (link to be provided soon).</p>
			<p> Localization tags so far include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-semitic languages and semitic languages (note these tags need more expansion for Chinese etc)</li>
				<li>Low context and high context cultures</li>
				<li>Familiarity with the Internet and web 2.0. Note this is often age related. Tags are: <ul>
						<li>Experienced Internet User: Uses Web 2.0 extensively, will use avatars and familiarizer with social media conventions.</li>
						<li> Intermediate Internet User: Knows how to use basic pages without thinking.</li>
						<li>Basic Internet user: Has learned about links and buttons.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Feel free to put in a technique even if you do not have all this information. However try to provide any research that you know of - even if it is just your own personal experience. If you add a localization category, please also add it to this introduction.</p></section>
			
			<section id="exemptions">
			<h3 id="x1-3-exemptions"><bdi class="secno">1.3 </bdi>Exemptions<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#exemptions"></a></h3>
      <p>The group feel the following situations can create exceptions to parts of techniques</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When techniques about writing styles detract from&nbsp;a key role of the text you can use a modified writing style guide instead. The modified writing style guide&nbsp;that the page conforms to, should be made public. &nbsp;Examples include content where the main role is &nbsp;artistic or literary (and not to pass on information, social, enable the user to complete a task or other role)</li>
              <li>If the main role of the text is artistic then use techniques about formatting styles when they do not detract from the main role of the content.</li>
              <li>If the main role of content is to evaluate the user's cognitive abilities, then use techniques as much as possible &nbsp;when they do not detract from the main role of the content.</li>
            </ul>

					<ul>
						<li>Identify 1-3 main tasks that covers most of what users want to do. Make sure it is obvious how to do them as soon as the content loads. </li>
						<li>Have one topic per page. </li>
						<li>Have one idea per paragraph. (One sentence is enough for a paragraph.) </li>
						<li>Have one point per sentences. Long sentences can often be broken up into short sentence or lists. If a sentence can use more then one conjuction or comer, it typically can be broken up.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>When personalization is supported, you can also divide content using  the  section tags. The user who prefer less content per page, could then see each section as a  separate page  with a next  button.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>When possible have no more than three clicks to get to information. </strong>Divide your pages into sections and subtopics. Try and ensure that it is clear what topic the page would be under. Ensure that it can be reached though any high level page that it logically could belong. Help and support should  be one click away</li>
					<li><strong>Provide different methods to find information. </strong>Provide a site map, and preferably a the search box as well. <br>
				  </li>
					<li><strong>Limit the number of links in each area</strong>. 
&nbsp; Have no more then seven  links in any one navigation section or under any one subheading. </li>

				<p>Simple present tense is usually easier to understand then other tenses</p>
				<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I am using the present tense"  as appose to "the present tense  was used"</p>
				<p>With  the&nbsp;<em>active voice,</em> the subject of sentence performs the action. Passive voice&nbsp;the subject receives the action. For example </p>
				<p><strong>Example - Active:&nbsp;</strong>Researchers <em>showed</em>&nbsp;that high stress&nbsp;<em>can cause</em>&nbsp;heart attacks.</p>
			  <p><strong>Example - Passive:</strong> High stress, has been proved by researchers to sometimes be the cause of heart attacks.</p>
			  <p>To identify passive voicing</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Check that it is clear who is  the subject of  the sentence </li>
					<li>The term "by" phrase often is used in passive voicing</li>
					<li>Possible use of 'you' but careful use of other pronouns such as 'she', 'he' etc ii</li>
					<li>Determiners such as 'this' and 'that' can confuse</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Exemption</p>
			  <p>There are times when passive voicing or other tense can be clearer.  In these cases, there is an exemption if active voicing has been shown in a user test to be harder to understand, less friendly or  inappropriate.</p>
				<p>For example: The sentence <em>"You many not eat here"</em> may be considered aggressive. <em>"Eating is not allowed in this room"</em> is just as clear and is less aggressive.</p>

				<p>Check long documents in sections to determine which parts are too hard to read. </p>
				<p>One way to do this is to use the Flesch Reading Ease score which rates text on a 100-point scale. The higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 70 to 80. </p>
				<p>The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score rates text on a U.S. grade-school level. For example, a score of 5.0 means that a fifth grader, i.e., a Year 6, average 10 years old, can understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 5.0 by using short sentences, not by simplifying vocabulary.</p>
				<p>In cases were a higher reading age is required (such as for a legal document) provide an easy to read summary of key points.</p>

				<p> Tooltips should be precise and relate directly to the object.</p>
				<p>When possible  tooltips should be able to be turned off via personalization. This is because  they may not be noticed by some who have severe aphasia and a visual agnosia and could add clutter and even confuse if they are read out by a screen reader or text to speech support. But for those with less severe difficulties they can be helpful.</p>

				<p>The amount of help offered by tooltips very much depends on the ability of the user as do many of the techniques above. </p>
				<p> These is helpful to most persons with intellectual disabilities. Sometimes a person with an intellectual disability can get confused and distracted. If tooltips are to be used they must precise and relate directly to the object.</p>

				<p> Where appropriate, create charts and graphics to provide additional ways to reinforce important concepts. Typically, if something can be shown in a chart or a graphic, it will help many users if it is provided.</p>
				<p>However, graphics should be clear and easy to identify what is going on</p>
				<p> The ability to “read between the lines” of a text, graphic, or lecture may seem like an exercise in “common sense,” but it may create barriers for students with autism, who may not be able to readily discern the intended relevance of graphical data.</p>
				<p> Clear explanations may reduce undue cognitive loads for all users.</p>
				<p>Further use aria-describedby to associate the graphic or sections of a graphic or chart and the text that describes it can be read by a screen reader whilst the right section of the chart is highlighted.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>These are subjective values and may not always be helpful especially when dealing with weather and ambient temperature (due to reasons such as variances in regional average temperature - what is considered hot in UK is considered cool in India or Thailand). It may be possible to use look up tables and JSON to query relative average temperature based upon locale and adjust temperature ranges accordingly. </p>
              <p>Give additional hints and pointers to users to give context.</p>
              <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
              <p>The requirement to convert between Centigrade and Fahrenheit and vice versa is burdensome so defaulting to the format of the locale removes one layer of complexity.</p>
              <p>Reading the values long form rather than using figures is helpful in for the same reasons outlined in the dates and calendar section.</p>

              <p>Even with all of the above in place a person may not be able to marry up the concept of temperature with the numbers so giving additional hints may help make the link to whether something is hot or cold.</p>
              <p>Use symbols where appropriate for example for weather the symbols used such as sun, snowflake, sun &amp; cloud will give some indication. </p>

Multiple layers of authentication compound problems and many banks require two-factor authentication that uses pass codes that time out after 30 seconds.  Reducing the requirement for this will be of great benefit to people with dyslexia, dyscalculia, anyone who has poor working memory or issues with sequencing.</p>

            <p>The international standard notation for the time of day is hh:mm:ss but this can be hard for those with cognitive impairments to fully comprehend - 10:30:10  may be read out as 10 hours, thirty minutes and 10 seconds by most text to speech engines but may be too long to remember.  The ISO advises the 24 hour clock for example 13:30 as opposed to 01.30pm - the latter is localized for English speakers but may help those with learning disabilities along with symbols to represent the period in the day such as suggest under calendars. </p>

            <p>It has been found that using linear text positioned horizontally on a page can enhance the results where numerical like rating scales are used to carry out research into people's views on a subject.  Using simple text is also important as this can help those with dementia and cognitive learning disabilities as well as those with dyscalculia, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder. </p>

            <p>Rather than having a scale of 1-5 where one is poor and 5 is excellent use the words across the page just under the question and it has also been shown that using the higher rating scale first can also impact positively on the results. </p>

            <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
            <p>Real concepts can be understood rather than abstract numbers  Using an absolute value is better than comparing values in such a way that an item when compared to another may appear to have a difference in value.  Use of imagery and/or text best supports this concept.  This also applies to relative sizes, quantity and distance.  These ideas support those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load. </p>

                              <li>If the user tries to select an invalid date it must be clear why a date can not be selected such as with a short clear and friendly error message (for example "sorry that date has passed). This avoids abandonment of the process.</li>
                              <li>Use terms that describe the present past and future days rather than just using numbers or dates. By using terminology such as <em>today</em>, <em>tomorrow</em> or <em>travel now</em> in the appropriate language for the locale, the user has a clear understanding of the timeliness of the event, booking or occasion. </li>
                              <li>Display long form of <strong>dates</strong> with punctuation, e.g., June 1st, 2015 or 1st June, 2015. This offers a clear understanding of the date. Punctuation helps the text to speech API read the date in a way that is easier to follow.</li>
                              <li>When using numbers for time - check use of appropriate punctuation between numbers when providing times as these may be read inappropriately by text to speech engines.</li>

                              <li>Use the default temperature format of locale. The requirement to convert between Centigrade and Fahrenheit and vice versa is burdensome so defaulting to the format of the locale removes one layer of complexity.</li>
                              <li>Allow reading of long form temperature. Reading the values long form rather than using figures is helpful in for the same reasons outlined in the dates and calendar section.</li>
                              <li>Reinforce with non-numerical values, e.g., Very Cold, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Very Hot. These are subjective values and may not always be helpful especially when dealing with weather and ambient temperature (due to reasons such as variances in regional average temperature - what is considered hot in UK is considered cool in India or Thailand). It may be possible to use look up tables and JSON to query relative average temperature based upon locale and adjust temperature ranges accordingly. </li>

                            <h5 id="example-1">Example<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#example-1"></a></h5>
                            <p>Currently many web based calendars require settings to be changed to suit the locale.  Users may not be aware of the start of the week in the locale e.g. Sunday in the Middle East and be unable to take appropriate actions to suit their needs.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pass example: </strong>Calendar settings recognize locale and/or offer the ability to edit settings</p>
                            <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>Incorrect punctuation and poorly localized date layout.</p>
                            <h5 id="example-2">Example<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#example-2"></a></h5>
                            <p>The booking form provides two calendars and user is able to select dates without warning as to whether they are possible e.g. flight out on June 1st - flight return May 30th.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pass example:</strong>User is unable to select inappropriate dates and/or simple explanation provided should he/she do so. </p>
                            <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>User can select inappropriate dates without warning.  Calendar merely grays out inappropriate dates which may not be noticed.  No warnings provided. </p>
						
					
			      <h5 id="example-3">Example<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#example-3"></a></h5>
			      <p>The booking form provides the option to select a short series of terms such as 'today' or 'tomorrow' as well as presenting a calendar.  This can speed booking times for those who have failed to organize their booking times in advance as well as those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load or situationally disabled. </p>
                  <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> User is able to select text based terms for days near to the appropriate booking times not just calendar dates. </p>
                  <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>Only calendar provided</p>
                  <h5 id="example-4">Example<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#example-4"></a></h5>
                  <p>In USA the month appears before the day which is reversed in UK e,g 06/01/2015 or 01/06/2015. Further dyslexics and other user groups will not often confuse the order.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> Month is given in text with numbers for date and year.</p>
                  <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>A series of numbers for the date.</p>
                  <h5 id="example-5">Example<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#example-5"></a></h5>
                  <p>The international standard notation for the time of day is hh:mm:ss but this can be hard for those with cognitive impairments to fully comprehend - 10:30:10  may be read out as 10 hours, thirty minutes and 10 seconds by most text to speech engines but may be too long to remember.  The ISO advises the 24 hour clock for example 13:30 as opposed to 01.30pm - the latter is localized for English speakers but may help those with learning disabilities along with symbols to represent the period in the day such as suggest under calendars. </p>
                  <p>Being able to hear the numbers for time repeatedly read out aloud accurately with 'text to speech' technologies can help comprehension and memory.  Developers need to be aware of how these technologies react to time formats.  This feature can provide those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load or situationally disabled with a better understanding of the concepts.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pass example: </strong>Numbers representing time can be read out accurately by text to speech engines.</p>
                  <p><strong>Failure example:</strong> Numbers fail to be read out accurately by text to speech engines. </p>
              
				<h5 id="example-6">Example <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#example-6"></a></h5>
				<p>Even with all of the above in place a person may not be able to marry up the concept of temperature with the numbers so giving additional hints may help make the link to whether something is hot or cold.</p>
				  <p>Use symbols where appropriate for example for weather the symbols used such as sun, snowflake, sun &amp; cloud will give some indication. </p>
				  <p>Pass example: The Temperature is Five Degrees Centigrade (Cold) <img src="img/SnowFlake.png" height="67" width="61" alt="snowflake" style="margin: 0px auto;"> hint: It's hat and scarf weather. </p>
				  <p>Failure example: Failure to explain figures representing relative values. Temperature = 21℃/70℉</p>
				  <p>The Temperature is Thirty Degrees Centigrade (Very hot) <img src="img/sun.png" height="62" width="62" alt="sun" style="margin: 0px auto;"> hint: It's shorts weather </p>

	          People living with dementia or MCI will often forget what they were doing. Attention deficit disorder also affects the ability to focus on a task. Those with aphasia may have visual and audio perceptual difficulties and be confused by sudden interruption and distracting happenings. Attention may be poor and there is a need to have time and space to concentrate on the task in hand. </section>

				<p>Use rich semantic tags to show what things are so that they can be adapted for the user.</p>
				<p>Use standardized  techniques as much as possible as this helps the user be familiar with the interface across many applications. </p>
				<p>When using personalization do not expose the user health and cognitive issues to anyone who may exploit them.</p>
				<p>This can be done in HTML</p>
				<p><strong>Example: </strong>&lt;h2&gt; contact us&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
                <p>You can also use   the aria attribute of aria-function. This allows the user agent to add symbols and extra help. (Under development)</p>
                <p><strong>Example (Under development):</strong> &lt;button&nbsp;type="button" coga-function="undo" &gt;default&lt;/button&gt;</p>

  Keep the user safe   <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#keep-the-user-safe"></a></h5>
  <p>For example: Do not expose user information in a way that can be exploited by other people. If the user agrees to have their information stored make sure that the consent is informed and that they fully understand the risks.</p>
  <p>For example: Do not  mislead  or confuse the user in a way that may do them harm. </p>
  <p>For example an commerce site that  automatically incrementing the number of items selected without warning the user, is trying to confuse the user. </p>
  <p>These mechanisms are particularly damaging for people with cognative disabilities who then feel they can not use the Internet safely.</p>

					<p>Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks. However, sometimes  they can introduce barriers   that are not necessary for using the content. </p>
					<p>When an author makes design choices that mean people who could have used their content now can not, that content is not accessible. </p>
	  </section>
  <p><strong>Examples in security: </strong></p>
				<p>Web security and privacy technologies, for example, intentionally require users to perceive more and to do more   to complete tasks. Three examples of these technologies are passwords, <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>, and 2-Factor Authentication. Such techniques require that the user has a good working memory or short term memory required to copy a code or  remember complex passwords.				</p>
				
				  <p>Alternatives exists that can alow more people to use content securely. These alternatives include using Web tokens, signing in via email account or face book, or biometrics are all alternatives to the above.

				<h5 id="calendar">Calendar<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#provide-symbols-on-key-content"></a></h5>
                When time is included in a calendar use clear icons or simple text to represent occurrences that may be repeated such as certain times of day for example icons for sun rising, sun past midday and sun going down or text such as morning (am) for 9-12 or afternoon for 1-4 (pm) etc. This technique can be applied to other items such as months and days if appropriate. 
                <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
                <p>By using simple symbols and/or text that can be an addition to numbers helps those who may be confused by times in the morning looking the same as a time in the evening if the am or pm is not noticed or the 24 hour clock causes problems.  6:30am and 6.30pm   0906 and 1906 or 1609.  Increased use of symbols can help those with receptive aphasia as well as other cognitive learning disabilities not just those with dyscalculia, dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. </p>

                <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> Icons or symbols are used to denote repeated times within the calendar as an addition to times and / or text. </p>
                <p><strong>Failure example</strong>: Only numbers for time included in a calendar where there are repetitions. </p>
