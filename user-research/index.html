    <p>Cognitive Accessibility User Research describes the challenges of using web technologies for people with learning
      disabilities or cognitive disabilities. The research describes challenges in the areas of attention,
      <!--behavior, -->
      <!--consciousness, -->executive function, knowledge, language
      <!-- and figurative language-->, literacy, memory, perception, and reasoning. It is organized by user groups of
      the following disabilities: Aging-Related Cognitive Decline, Aphasia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,
      Autism, Intellectual Disability, Dyscalculia, Dyslexia, and Non-Verbal. Additional user groups may be added to
      future versions. This document provides a basis for subsequent work to identify gaps in current technologies,
      suggest strategies to improve accessibility for these user groups, and develop guidance and techniques for web
      authors.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document provides background research on user groups with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities;
      and challenges they face when using Web technologies. We aim to identify and describe the current situation so
      subsequent publications can contrast it to what we want to happen.</p>
    <p>This document will be used as a base document to enable the task force to perform a gap analysis; suggest
      techniques; and create a road-map for improving accessibility for people with learning disabilities and cognitive
      disabilities.</p>
    <p>It is currently at its first draft. We are asking for comments. Please let us know if you are aware of omissions.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Importance of This Document</h3>
      <p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web and
        Web technologies is of critical importance to both individuals and society.</p>
      <p>More and more, the Internet and the Web have become the main way people stay informed and current on news and
        health information; keep in touch with friends and family; and provide independence such as convenient shopping
        etc. People who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of having a disability and of being
        alienated from society. </p>
      <p>Further, with the advent of the Web of Things, everyday physical objects are connected to the Internet and have
        Web interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now is an essential component of allowing people to maintain
        their independence, stay in the work force for longer, and stay safe.  </p>
      <p>Consider that the population is aging. By 2050, it is projected there will be 115 million people with dementia
        worldwide. It is essential to the economy and society that people with mild and moderate levels of dementia stay
        as active as possible, and participate in society for as long as possible. However, at the moment, even people
        with only a mild cognitive decline may find standard applications impossible to use. That means more and more
        people are dependent on care givers for things that they could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of
        care and reducing human dignity.</p>
      <p>We therefore invite you to review this draft; and comment and consider how your technologies and work may be
        affected by these issues.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Assumptions</h3>
      <p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the
        possibilities, the job will be too big, and nothing will be achieved. Therefore, we are adopting a phased
        approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something
        useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of
        scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups
        are analyzed, and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> 
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>This is an early and incomplete draft for review; and to help us get comments and early feedback. We are
        particularly interested in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>omitted challenges, use cases, and issues;</li>
        <li>issues involving your technologies/work and people with learning and cognitive disabilities; and</li>
        <li>other omitted research.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We welcome comments and suggestions. Please send comments to pubic-coga-comments@w3.org. All comments will be
        reviewed and discussed by the task force. Although we cannot commit to formally responding to all comments on
        this draft, the discussions can be tracked in the task force minutes.</p>

    <h2>Summary of User Groups and Cognitive Function</h2>
    <p>Different people with cognitive disabilities may have problems in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Memory</strong> -
        Including: Working Memory, Short-Term Memory, Long-Term Memory, Visual Memory, Visuo-spatial Memory, Auditory
        Memory (memory for sound patterns and others).</li>
      <li><strong>Executive Functions</strong> - Including: Emotional Control and Self-Monitoring; Planning/Organization
        and Execution; and Judgment.</li>
      <li><strong>Reasoning</strong> - Including: Fluid Reasoning (logical reasoning), Mathematical Intelligence,
        Seriation, Crystallized Intelligence, and Abstraction.</li>
      <li><strong>Attention</strong> - Including: Selective Attention, and Sustained Attention.</li>
      <li><strong>Language</strong> - Including: Speech Perception, Auditory Discrimination, Naming Skills, and
        Morphosyntax.</li>
      <li><strong>Understanding Figurative Language</strong> - Including: similes, personification, oxymorons, idioms,
        and puns.</li>
      <li><strong>Literacy</strong> - Depends upon functions including: Speech Perception, Visual Perception, Phoneme
        Processing, and Cross-Modal Association (association of sign and concept).</li>
      <li><strong>Other Perception</strong> - Including: Motor Perception, Psychomotor Perception.</li>
      <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> - Including: Cultural Knowledge, Jargon (subject matter); Web Jargon and
        Technology; Metaphors and Idioms; Symbols Knowledge (such as icons); and Mathematical Knowledge. </li>
      <li><strong>Behavioral</strong> - Including: Understanding Social Cues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information, please see section 5.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that people may have limitations in one area and not in other areas. For example, a
      person with dyslexia may have above-average reasoning, but impaired visual memory and literacy skills. A person
      with Intellectual Disability may have an above-average visual memory, but impaired judgment.

            <p>Receptive and Expressive Aphasia may result in impaired short term memory which can impact on re-learning

              that affects reading and writing. Visuo-spatial Memory maybe an issue with the inability to remember how
              to get to places and recall locations, not helped if procedural memory is also involved where the order of
              doing things is affected. This is usually automatic but actions may have to be relearnt and there can be
              involvement of prospective memory that involves being aware of when certain activities have to be
              performed. </p>

            symbolic representations of speech such as pictograms and other photographic symbols. This may result in a
            very reduced number of symbols being used on a daily basis. Lack of Auditory memory affects the ability to
            gain skills in phonemic awareness that aids literacy skills. Difficulties with visuo-spatial memory impact
            on the speed withwhich symbols may be found on a communication board or located on a screen and with
            physical difficulties this can further slow communication. Procedural memory difficulties result in poor

    <h2>Research on Cognitive Function</h2>
    This section aims to provide:
    <ul>
      <li>a basis for consistent use of terms within our documents;</li>
      <li>a basis / background for making tags that can be used in meta data or functional-accessibility approach</li>
      <li>a useful resource</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: We have taken terms and concepts from across the work we are doing on disability and cognitive function.
      Where more than one term exists for what seems to be a very similar function, we have chosen one term, but brought
      others for reference. We have also reviewed the <a href="http://iapsych.com/articles/mcgrew2009.pdf">Caroll
        taxonomy</a>, but it was focused on educational assessment, and psychometric-based models for human
      intelligence, and was therefore not fully-relevant (for example: knowledge categories). When quoting a Caroll
      category, we have tried to put the mnemonic after the term such as (RG) or (I). </p>
    <p>
      Here are the cognitive functions that we have identified so far. They are not complete, and not yet in a taxonomy
      form.</p>

      <h3>Reasoning and Executive Functions</h3>
      <p><strong>Executive functions</strong> (also known as cognitive control and supervisory-attentional system) is an
        umbrella term for the management of cognitive processes such as reasoning and problem solving (goal-focused
        reasoning) as described below. Executive function also includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>emotional control and self-monitoring</li>
        <li>shift ( also called task flexibility)</li>
        <li>initiation</li>
        <li>planning/organization</li>
        <li>execution</li>
      </ul>
      Executive function also relies upon or includes: working memory, other memory (short, long), attention,
      abstraction, associations, as described below.
      <p>In making a decision or conclusion, we <em>may</em> use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluid</strong> (logical) reasoning;</li>
        <li>Attitudes and experience from or guiding <strong>Crystallized intelligence</strong>;</li>
        <li>An <strong>Affective component</strong> involving a person’s emotions (such as fear) and identity (sense of
          self).</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral</strong> (or cognitive) component involving memory, such as long-term autobiographical
          memory.</li>
      </ul>
      <section>
        <h4>Reasoning</h4>
        <p><strong>Fluid reasoning</strong> is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations,
          independent of acquired knowledge [<a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence">Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence</a>]
          Fluid intelligence may involve both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. </p>
        <p>Types of fluid reasoning are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Deductive Reasoning</strong> (RG) (sometimes called General or Sequential or hypothetico-deductive
            reasoning). It is the ability to start with stated assertions (rules, premises, or conditions), and engage
            in one or more steps leading to a solution.</li>
          <li><strong>Inductive Reasoning</strong> (Induction (I) Reasoning from specific cases or observations to
            general rules or to broad generalizations. Often requires the ability to combine separate pieces of
            information in the formation of inferences, rules, hypotheses, or conclusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Mathematical Intelligence</strong> (also called Quantitative Reasoning (RQ) depends upon ability
            to inductively (I) and/or deductively (RG) reason with concepts involving mathematical relations and
            properties.</li>
          <li><strong>Piagetian Reasoning</strong> (PR): reasoning via <em>seriation</em> (organizing material into an
            orderly series that facilitates understanding of relationships between events), <em>conservation</em>
            (awareness that physical quantities do not change in amount when altered in appearance), and
            <em>classification</em>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A related idea is Speed of Reasoning (RE): Speed or fluency in performing reasoning tasks
          [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~itm/688/wk6/CHC%20Definitions.pdf]</p>
        <p><strong>Crystallized Intelligence</strong> (sometimes called Comprehension Knowledge), is the ability to use
          skills, knowledge, and experience. It does not equate to memory, but it does rely on accessing information
          from long-term memory. Crystallized intelligence is one’s lifetime of intellectual achievement, as
          demonstrated largely through one's vocabulary and general knowledge. [<a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence&lt;/cite</a>&gt;
          Crystallized Intelligence involves storage and usage of long-term memories, such as by the hippocampus.</p>
        <p>We have included the dependent aspects in the sections on memory and language [

      </section>
      <section id="attention">
        <h4 id="h4_attention" role="heading">Attention</h4>
        <p>Reasoning and executive functions require attention. Types of attention are the following.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Selective attention</strong> refers to the ability to attend to some stimuli while disregarding
            others irrelevant to the task at hand. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
          <li><strong>Divided attention</strong> tasks require the processing of two or more sources of information, or
            the performance of two or more tasks at the same time. (Divided attention has usually been associated with
            significant age-related declines in performance, particularly when tasks are complex.) [<a
              href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/#ch1.r5">5</a>]. The cost of dividing attention is
            assessed by comparing performance under dual-task conditions to performance when the tasks are performed
            separately. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
          <li> <strong>Sustained attention</strong> refers to the ability to maintain concentration on a task over an
            extended period. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Abstraction</h4>
        Types of abstraction include:
        <ul>
          <li>essentialism</li>
          <li>object recognition - Abstraction is part of visual comprehension </li>
          <li>face recognition (seems to be separate from object recognition)</li>
          <li>facial patterns (such as an angry face)</li>
          <li>linguistical abstractions (such as relations between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.)</li>
          <li>quantities</li>
          <li>numerical concepts</li>
          <li>abstract context of time</li>
          <li>spatial orientation, directions, layout of things.</li>
          <li>mechanical abstractions</li>
          <li>musical abstractions</li>
          <li>behavioral and social abstractions –
            <ul>
              <li>norms, etc</li>
              <li>social cues</li>
              <li>other behavioral:

      <h3>Memory</h3>
      <p>People talk about types of memories are often talking about different categories of types of memory. Any
        memory-based events can be described in all these categories. For example: an event may cause a sensory
        experience to go into long-term memory implicitly. Here are the types we have identified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>durationbased:</strong> working, long term, short term, and possibly intermediary</li>
        <li><strong>context based:</strong> emotional, procedural, sensory (tactile, smell, psychomotor, kinesthetic,
          olfactory, auditory, visual, visuo-spatial, spatial, musical, and prospective memory.</li>
        <li> <strong>awareness level</strong>: implicit and explicit</li>
      </ul>
      <section>
        <h4>Duration Based</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Working memory</strong> involves mentally manipulating — is the system that actively holds
            multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind, where they can be manipulated. <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#cite_note-Cowan-1">[1]</a> Baddeley and Hitch feel it is
            executive and attention control of short-term memory, but others point out that long term memory can also be
            involved in working memory.</li>
          <li><strong>Short-term memory</strong> (also called active or primary memory) typically lasts seconds, such as
            remembering the phone number while you find a pen and write it down. Subtypes are Verbal, Visual, and
            Spatial. Four different units in short-term memory are probably average. Capacity of short-term memory is
            often called memory span.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term memory</strong> (also called reference memory, long-term storage and retrieval
            (Glr),TSR, Glm), the ability to store and consolidate new information in memory and later fluently retrieve
            stored information. Broad retrieval ability (G) is a related idea.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Context Based</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Episodic memory</strong> (autobiographical – time, self)</li>
          <li><strong>Semantic</strong> memory (factual)</li>
          <li><strong>Visual memory</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Visuo-spatial memory</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Spatial memory</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Musical memory</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Auditory memory:</strong> Memory for sound patterns (UM)</li>
          <li><strong>Procedural memory:</strong> Memory for performance of particular types of action such as walking.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Prospective memory</strong>: Much of what we have to remember in everyday life involves
            prospective memory — remembering to do things in the future, such as keep appointments, return a book to the
            library, or pay bills on time. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional memories:</strong> can be both declarative- and procedural-memory processes. </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Awareness Based</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Implicit memory</strong>: (Can be called non-declarative memory) is built or used without
            conscious awareness. In contrast with... </li>
          <li><strong>Explicit memory</strong>: (Can be called declarative memory) the intentional use of memory such as
            remembering the time of an appointment or studying for an exam.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <p>Also, memories can be stored and recalled as<strong> Associative Memory</strong> (AM), <strong>Meaningful
          memory</strong>(MM), <strong>Free-recall memory</strong> (M6),</p>

      <h3>Language</h3>
      <p>Speak, write, read, or understand speech and/or language.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>Spoken Languages</h4>
        The basic skills for spoken languages seem to be <strong>speech perception</strong>.
        Speech perception is when sounds of language are heard, interpreted, and understood. This depends upon:
        <ul>
          <li>Auditory Discrimination (Note: not loss of hearing, but identification and differentiation of sounds, also
            called General sound discrimination (U3) </li>
          <li>Temporal Tracking (UK)</li>
          <li>Listening Ability (LS)</li>
          <li>Naming skills (N)</li>
          <li>Related memory such as Working Memory, auditory memory - (Memory for sound patterns)</li>
          <li>Morphosyntax: The system of the internal structure of words (morphology) and the way in which words are
            put together to form phrases and sentences (syntax).</li>
          <li>Understanding figural language, including a simile (a comparison of two things, such as “His cheeks were
            like roses”; a metaphor; onomatopoeia (a word designed to be an imitation of a sound such as “Bark! Bark!”);
            personification (attribution of a personal nature to inanimate objects); an oxymoron (opposite or
            contradictory terms are used together for emphasis, such as “organized chaos”); a paradox;a hyperbole (an
            extreme exaggeration, such as “I was so upset I nearly died”); allusion; or idiom, such as "You should keep
            your eye out for him"); and puns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Spoken language also requires an ability to produce voice </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Sign Language</h4>
        <p>Sign language, without spoken language, probably requires a slightly-different set of skills, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual Recognition Skills</li>
          <li>Non-vocal Naming - Association of sign and concept</li>
          <li>Phoneme Processing and Phonetic coding (PC)</li>
          <li>Related memory, such as Working Memory, Visual memory, Memory for patterns</li>
          <li>Morphosyntax: The system of the internal structure of words (morphology) and the way in which words are
            put together to form phrases and sentences (syntax).</li>
          <li>Understanding figural language.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Literacy</h4>
        <p>Beyond basic language, literacy typically requires:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual Recognition (see below)</li>
          <li>Visual memory (not affected in Intellectual Disability)</li>
          <li>Phoneme Processing and Phonetic coding (PC)</li>
          <li>Cross-modal Association of sign and concept</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that many people with dyslexia achieve literacy without many of these functions, or with impaired
          functioning.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Note that these are in our mandate. For example: Dementia with Lewy bodies affects the cerebrum, where small
        round lumps of proteins build up and can cause fluctuations of consciousness, as well as hallucinations,
        delusions (firmly held beliefs in things that are not real), and false ideas (such as with paranoia).

    <h2>Methodology in User Research</h2>
    <p>In making user scenarios and user group research, we took a multilevel approach including: </p>
    <section>
      <h3>Asking Users</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>What do they have trouble with? </li>
        <li>What tasks do they need help with? </li>
        <li>What tasks they avoid?</li>
        <li>What tasks often lead to mistakes?</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Addressing Specific Topics</h3>
      <p>In the user group research section of the gap analysis, we aim to identify abstract principles for
        accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities; core challenges for each user group; as well
        as practical techniques. </p>
      <p>However, when trying to identify abstract principles, it is often helpful to look at concrete-user scenarios
        and challenges that different user groups face. For that purpose, we have identified practical and diverse user
        scenarios that should be considered in user-group research. These include: </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Communication</h4>
        <p>Making sure users can communicate with people and be part of society. Tasks to investigate:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>use email and chat effectively </li>
          <li>be aware of a change </li>
          <li>share pictures and information </li>
          <li>play </li>
          <li>request information </li>

          <li>Apps to enable work, such as document authoring </li>
          <li>Critical <abbr title="Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language">DHTML</abbr> content and applications such as:
            enroll and manage healthcare; make an appointment; enroll and manage banking; shop online. </li>

          <li>Find out rights and social-service information. </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Cross-Cutting Concerns</h3>
      <p>Using content should be: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>safe </li>
        <li>effective </li>

    <h2>Potential for Inclusion</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Proposed Directions</h3>
      <p>The aim of the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA) is to improve Web
        accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. </p>
      <p>This is a background-research document. However, it may be worth concluding with an overview of what could be
        done for accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It is intended to help us (COGA)
        identify what needs to be done to get there.</p>
      <p class="note">Note that some of the ideas below may be out of scope for our mandate and role as a <abbr
          title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> task force.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>What is Needed</h3>
        <p><img alt="The pieces of what needs to happen next (described in the text below)" src="img/vision.png" /></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Techniques for Everyone</h3>
        <p>A substantial amount of techniques are helpful  for over 90% of people with cognitive disabilities. These
          techniques need to be gathered in one place.</p>
        <p>For example, most people with any cognitive disability may be disturbed when form data is lost when a session
          times out. Almost all user groups may need help or  need to double check data entered into a form. Timing out
          so they need to start again may make a form unusable.</p>
        <p> See <a href="http://w3c.github.io/coga/templates/technique-template.html">sample technique format</a> to
          help us gather techniques as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later
          when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Techniques for User Groups</h3>
        <p>We also need to document techniques good for some user groups and not for others (depends upon cognitive
          function and localization). For example, text under symbols may be useful for many people with dementia, but
          unhelpful for many people with severe language disabilities.</p>
        <p>In a localization example using left-hand-side text, alignment is helpful for  English sites, but
          right-hand-side text alignment is  helpful for sites in Arabic or Hebrew.</p>
        <p> See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/TechniquesCOGA.html">sample page structure and more
            examples</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Grouping Techniques</h3>
        <p>Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques,  we may want to group techniques  into “enhancements”. For
          example, we may make a group of techniques as “simple text” enhancements for easier reference. </p>
        <p>We may also want to identify how different enhancements benefit people with different limitations of
          cognitive functions. </p>
        <p>To achieve this, we may need to label groups of cognitive functions, so that we can simplify linking
          enhancements to cognitive functions. See <a
            href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml">an initial page of cognitive
            function</a>. </p>
        <p>Once we have a set of enhancements, we can enable standards, such as <abbr
            title="Evaluation and Report Language">EARL</abbr>, to identify  which documents support which enhancements.
          Other supported standards and systems include <abbr
            title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>, <abbr
            title="Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure">GPII</abbr> including subprojects Prosperity4All and
          Cloud4all, and possibly FLUID.</p>
        <p>Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques, we can also explore what is needed to make a website
          adaptable to different groups of users.  We may be able to identify semantics that enable adaptation for
          specific learning and cognitive disabilities; and to conflicting needs of different users. </p>
        <p> This could include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>adaptive text: This would enable text to become simpler or more literal or adapt to the user needs.</li>
          <li>adaptive components: There are many ways to make the same widget. Because different web sites implement
            the same functions differently, the user needs to learn how to interact and use them with specific-page
            widgets. Adaptive components would enable the user to use one interface, which they know how to use, across
            many different sites.</li>
          <li>adaptive pages: This would enable changing or adapting the page layout, cutting out extra features or
            confusing aspects of the page. This would add semantics to enable adaptive interfaces and AT. This would
            enable adaptive interfaces to allow users to use complex interfaces via an independent and familiar
            interface tailored to their scenarios and strengths. As this interface is designed for the user/user group,
            all features are familiar, and the same buttons and metaphors will be used across all conformant
            applications.</li>
          <li>adaptive media</li>
          <li>adaptive forms and billing: This may result in suggestions to ARIA 2.0  and PF for additional semantics to
            enable AT to provide techniques.  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>(See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognitive/adaptable1.html">more information about making
            adaptable content for people with cognitive disabilities</a>)</p>
        <p>This may result in suggestions  to PF group for the ARIA 2.0 specification.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Special Projects</h3>
        <p>There may be other accommodations needed that are outside the handshaking approach or adaptable pages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessible -menu systems for people with  cognitive disabilities: This will look at what measures or
            techniques  could make phone menu systems usable by for people with  cognitive disabilities, such as
            enabling people to reach an operator.  (Relevant specification: voice Ml)</li>
          <li>Interoperable AAC symbols AND </li>
          <li>Lexicon and symbols that support low literacy.</li>
          <li>Labels for cognitive function: See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml">
              an early draft</a>.</li>
        </ul>
