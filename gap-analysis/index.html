It builds on the information presented in Cognitive Accessibility User Research [coga-user-research] and Cognitive Accessibility Issue Papers [coga-issue-papers] to evaluate where user needs remain to be met in technologies and accessibility guidelines. For various accessibility issues, this document provides a summary of issues and techniques, then identifies gaps and unmet user needs and suggest ways technologies may meet these needs in the future."><link rel="canonical" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-gap-analysis/"><style>.hljs{display:block;overflow-x:auto;padding:.5em;color:#383a42;background:#fafafa}.hljs-comment,.hljs-quote{color:#717277;font-style:italic}.hljs-doctag,.hljs-formula,.hljs-keyword{color:#a626a4}.hljs-deletion,.hljs-name,.hljs-section,.hljs-selector-tag,.hljs-subst{color:#ca4706;font-weight:700}.hljs-literal{color:#0b76c5}.hljs-addition,.hljs-attribute,.hljs-meta-string,.hljs-regexp,.hljs-string{color:#42803c}.hljs-built_in,.hljs-class .hljs-title{color:#9a6a01}.hljs-attr,.hljs-number,.hljs-selector-attr,.hljs-selector-class,.hljs-selector-pseudo,.hljs-template-variable,.hljs-type,.hljs-variable{color:#986801}.hljs-bullet,.hljs-link,.hljs-meta,.hljs-selector-id,.hljs-symbol,.hljs-title{color:#336ae3}.hljs-emphasis{font-style:italic}.hljs-strong{font-weight:700}.hljs-link{text-decoration:underline}</style><style>var{position:relative;cursor:pointer}var[data-type]::after,var[data-type]::before{position:absolute;left:50%;top:-6px;opacity:0;transition:opacity .4s;pointer-events:none}var[data-type]::before{content:"";transform:translateX(-50%);border-width:4px 6px 0 6px;border-style:solid;border-color:transparent;border-top-color:#000}var[data-type]::after{content:attr(data-type);transform:translateX(-50%) translateY(-100%);background:#000;text-align:center;font-family:"Dank Mono","Fira Code",monospace;font-style:normal;padding:6px;border-radius:3px;color:#daca88;text-indent:0;font-weight:400}var[data-type]:hover::after,var[data-type]:hover::before{opacity:1}</style><script id="initialUserConfig" type="application/json">{

			<p>This document is a gap analysis and roadmap for the state of accessibility for people with learning and cognitive disabilities when using the Web and information technologies. It builds on the information presented in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-user-research/">Cognitive Accessibility User Research</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-user-research" title="Cognitive Accessibility User Research">coga-user-research</a></cite>] and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/">Cognitive Accessibility Issue Papers</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-issue-papers" title="Issue Papers for the The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)">coga-issue-papers</a></cite>] to evaluate where user needs remain to be met in technologies and accessibility guidelines. For various accessibility issues, this document provides a summary of issues and techniques, then identifies gaps and unmet user needs and suggest ways technologies may meet these needs in the future.</p>
			
			<p>This document also contains a section with practical advice on <a href="#a-appendix-making-content-usable-for-people-with-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities">how to make content usable for people with learning and cognitive disabilities</a>. Content developers may prefer to start there. We hope it will meet the needs of web developers, content creators and policy makers. </p>

			
			<p>This document is part of a set of related informative publications from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/">Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force</a> (COGA TF), a joint task force of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> (APA WG) and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> (AG WG) of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>.</p>

			<p>Feedback on any aspect of the document is accepted. For this publication, the Working Groups particularly seek feedback on the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are any use cases or user needs missing?</li>
				<li>Do the gaps identified describe current needs for improvement in guidelines and technologies?</li>
				<li>Is there a need for further approaches to meet the needs of users with cognitive or learning disabilities?</li>

<section class="informative" id="introduction">
			<h2 id="x1-introduction"><bdi class="secno">1. </bdi>Introduction<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#introduction"></a></h2><p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
			<p>The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force's aim is to improve web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. </p>
	
	<p>This document contains a gap analysis and review of key issues, a roadmap for inclusion for different user needs.</p>
	<p>It is designed for standards groups and policy makers. However, it has useful information for anyone trying to understand the topic. There is also an appendix on <a href="#a-appendix-making-content-usable-for-people-with-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities">how to make content usable for people with leaning and cognitive disabilities</a>. Content developers may find this section the most useful.</p>
	<p>This is being done as part of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Accessible Platform Architecture Working Group (APA WG), part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. Challenges facing this work include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lack of availability of open research: Research on this topic tends to be behind a “paywall” which means that developers and policy makers may be unable to find out what techniques are proven to work to address the needs of people with disabilities</li>
				<li>There is a wide range of cognitive disabilities; each type of impairment is different, with diverse symptoms and particular digital accessibility requirements. This adds to the complexity of knowing how to address user needs.</li>
				<li>The advice given in the research and available guidance is often vague and is not testable. So, even if developers read the research they would not know exactly what to do or when they have reached an acceptable level of accessibility.</li>
			    <li>Another major challenge is capturing difficulties related to cognitive disabilities that may be undeclared. People with cognitive disabilities may be embarrassed about their disabilities and may be less likely to request accommodations. They may be       afraid of discrimination, especially in the work place. Others are not aware of their disability or of the impact it has on their functioning.</li>
                   <li>Attitudes and misinformation can       also become a barrier to inclusion for people with cognitive disabilities.       For example, developers that may feel people with cognitive disabilities       are not in their "target audience" and so have no interest in their inclusion. Also, studies of usability often over-sample college students. This       can mean that the results work less well for those inadequately       represented among sub-groups of college students (such the aging       population).</li>
			
              <li>Attitudes and misinformation can also become a barrier to inclusion for people with cognitive disabilities. For example, developers that may feel people with cognitive disabilities are not in their “target audience” and so have no interest in their inclusion. Also, studies of usability often over-sample college students. Thus the results work less well for groups who are not well represented among sub-groups of college students (such the aging population).</li>
              <li>Accessibility has typically been based upon the assumption that any website can be designed to be usable by people with disabilities. However, when making a website usable for people with cognitive disabilities, the content itself may need to be changed (e.g. simplified), or support adaptability (e.g. multi-modal delivery).</li>
            </ul>
			<p>Addressing these issues requires us to make a broader view of solutions for accessibility, such as a content focused approach and to explore personalization solutions that incorporate inclusive design. To address these issues we have adopted the following strategies:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select a <strong>phased approach</strong>. In our first phase we looked at eight different disabilities or categories that cut across types of cognitive impairment in terms of severity and brain function. Although some user needs might not have been identified in this phase, this approach made the work involved practical and it is likely that most key needs will have been identified. Other cognitive disabilities and emotional disabilities may be included in  phase 2 and the current user groups may be re-examined.</li>
				<li>Compile <strong>user research</strong> and literature reviews on the selected disability groups. These literature reviews mean that key findings are in the public domain and are easily available.</li>
				<li>Compile a list of <strong>authoring techniques</strong> that include the most useful strategies from all the different user group research&nbsp; </li>
				<li>Create testable and widely adoptable sets of <strong>success criteria</strong> that let authors know exactly what they need to do and when they have completed the task. (This might then be added to WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag20" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0">WCAG20</a></cite>] for cognitive disabilities)</li>
				<li>Author a series of <strong>issue papers</strong>  [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-issue-papers" title="Issue Papers for the The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)">coga-issue-papers</a></cite>] that explore topics beyond simple content such as security or personalization.</li>
				<li>Review the techniques and issue papers to <strong>identify the gaps</strong> between what is currently supported in accessibility guidelines and in the web architecture and what is needed to enable accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities</li>
				<li><strong>Create a roadmap</strong> to show how we can fill these gaps.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In addition to this gap analysis we have first drafts of the following accompanying documents: (Note they are works in progress and may change.)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Background research document. (See
                  
[<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-user-research" title="Cognitive Accessibility User Research">coga-user-research</a></cite>].)</li>
				<li>Issue papers on topics such as security, safety and how they are affected by cognitive disabilities. (See 
			    [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-coga-issue-papers" title="Issue Papers for the The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)">coga-issue-papers</a></cite>].)</li>
				<li>An authoring techniques document, including <ul>
						<li>techniques that help all users and </li>
						<li>techniques that help specific user groups.</li>
						<li>More details can be found in the techniques document available from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The techniques will also lead to a proposal for a WCAG 2.1  (see appendix two).</li>
				<li>Draft for a semantics for adaptive interfaces (that may become a WAI-ARIA [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wai-aria" title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0">wai-aria</a></cite>] extension) and personalization syntax to enable adaptable interfaces (see appendix one for details).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The diagram shows how these need to be integrated to enable accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities</p>

<p>A roadmap must enable the integration  of all the pieces that can make accessibility for people with cognitive  disabilities workable. A roadmap must also address the author needs and issues  that will help make this work practical. For example: Best practice documents  and how to ensure that personalization is practical and testable.</p>

  </figure>
			<p>The diagram shows what we are anticipating moving towards a roadmap. (Note that this work has yet to be completed.)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User research (phase 1)</li>
				<li>Gap analysis</li>
				<li>Author techniques and <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards integration (such as WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag20" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0">WCAG20</a></cite>] and VOICE ML or ARIA [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wai-aria" title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0">wai-aria</a></cite>])</li>
				<li>Support and possible standardization of preference (user settings) and metadata so that terms and setting are interoperable and user needs can be met across different Web applications. (Integration with other standards). </li>
				<li>Web semantics that enable personalization of content such that web authors can employ mechanisms that adapt Web content to meet the needs of the user according to the&nbsp;user preferences.</li>
				<li>Author support providing examples and supporting materials such as best practices and techniques. Test cases for personalization. </li>
				<li>Middleware and user agent guidance</li>
				<li>Browser and operating system guidance</li>
				<li>Suggestions for tools: For example guidance for authoring and conformance tools and user agents.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then we can start the process again with  phase 2 for additional research and new user groups, possibly including emotional disabilities.</p>

				<h3 id="x1-1-importance-of-this-document"><bdi class="secno">1.1 </bdi>Importance of This Document<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#importance-of-this-document"></a></h3>
				<p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web and Web technologies is of critical importance to both individuals and society.</p>
				<p>More  and more, the Internet and the Web have become the main way people stay  informed and current on news and health matters; keep in touch with friends and  family; and it can provide independence such as convenient shopping etc. People  who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of having a  disability and of being alienated from society. </p>
				<p>
			    Further,  with the advent of the Web of Things, everyday physical objects are connected  to the Internet and have Web interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now  is an essential component of allowing people to maintain their independence, stay in the work force for longer, and stay safe. </p>
				<p>
			    Consider  that the population is aging. The global share of population aged 60 years or  over is expected to reach 21.1 per cent by 2050 and is typically higher in  developed countries. A majority of people over 60 years old notice a decline in  memory and executive function such as an Age Associated Memory Impairment  (38.4%), Mild Cognitive Impairment (15.3%) or less frequently, dementia (8.8%).  That means more and more people are dependent on others for things that they  could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of care and reducing human  dignity.</p>
<p>We therefore invite you to review this draft; and comment and consider how your technologies and work may be affected by these issues.</p>

				<p>People with cognitive and learning disabilities may be unable to use web content because of the design choices of the author. Examples include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> People with impaired short term memory are unlikely to be able to remember passwords and access codes. They may have trouble or be unable to remember new symbols and interface paradigms. </li>
					<li>People with language related disabilities may need simple clear language and instructions. They may also need supporting graphics and familiar symbols</li>

				<p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the possibilities, the job will be too big, and nothing will be achieved. Therefore, we are adopting a phased approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups are analyzed, and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios. </p>

			<p>As discussed above, the task force reviewed different disabilities to identify techniques that supported their using the web. The task force also reviewed issues that went beyond standard Web content, but affected the use of the Web for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
			<p>This section is a summary of these findings. The full reports can be found in the appendix design guide and summary of issues and our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.

				<h3 id="x2-1-overview-of-techniques"><bdi class="secno">2.1 </bdi>Overview of Techniques<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#overview-of-techniques"></a></h3>
				<p>Most designers want people to be able to use their site. However designs that might be difficult for some people to use can actually bar people with cognitive and learning disabilities from using the content at all. Typically this happens because content providers may not be familiar with the needs of users having these impairments. We have reviewed multiple user groups as a first phase to identify user needs and challenges that are not fully included in WCAG.  From this research we have identified techniques and themes though the techniques that authors need to be aware of (and are not full addressed in WCAG 2.0) The key themes are: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Help as many users as possible understand the site and know how to use it. This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design patters. Personalization based on user needs and markup properly annotated with cognitive semantics can help make the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. </li>
					<li>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur. A good design and use of proven scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to render other data or start from the beginning. </li>
					<li>Help the user to refocus and to restore context if attention is lost. Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes) </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Main techniques include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Use a clear structure with easy to follow sections short paragraphs manageable chunks </li>
					<li> Use an easy to follow writing style </li>
					<li> Provide rapid and direct feedback </li>
					<li> Help the user understand the content and orientate themselves in the content. </li>
			        <li>Help users complete and check       their work  to make it       less likely that the user will make mistakes and  easier to       undo mistakes when they occur </li>
				
                  <li> Provide help </li>
                  <li> Help the user focus and help restore the context if attention is lost </li>
                  <li> Enable adaptability and personalization, so that symbols text and other features   are familiar and helpful to the user </li>
                  <li> Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content and avoid barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content, such as hard to use security mechanisms. </li>
                </ul>
				<p>A full list of the authoring techniques identified can be found in the design guide appendix. </p>

				<h3 id="x2-2-summary-of-technique-solutions"><bdi class="secno">2.2 </bdi>Summary of Technique Solutions <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#summary-of-technique-solutions"></a></h3>
				<p>To help bridge the gap we propose the following strategies: </p>
				<p>1. Construct a full list of techniques.</p>
				<p>2. Support an extension to [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0">WCAG</a></cite>] that supports the techniques. This will include: </p>
				<ol>
					<li> Writing new WCAG Success criteria and techniques. </li>
					<li> Suggesting changes to existing success criteria such as changing the text or the conformance level </li>
					<li> Proposing new success criteria when necessary. </li>
				</ol>
				(See appendix two for details of the new WCAG Success criteria and techniques.)
				<p>As part of this effort it is important to make this guidance as clear and prescriptive as possible, so that author knows what they need to do and when they have met the requirements. </p>
				<p>3. Create a new semantics specification  to define the associated semantics required for content adaptation. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>This could be done via a  WAI- ARIA module or a new Cognitive semantics specification </li>
					<li>The techniques for adaptation <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> use these semantics </li>
					<li>Specify concrete user settings to represent user preferences that can be used to direct a web application on how to modify the content </li>
					
				</ol>
				(See appendix one for details on the proposed semantics.)
				<p>4. Define testing criteria to ensure the authors know when they are done. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>This may include new rule sets </li>
					<li>This may require the creation of a test suite or specification. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>5. Support, and when appropriate, enable better personalization and adaption of content to meet our users' needs. This has the following advantages:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> It reduces the effort needed by the author. The author will just need to enable personalization, which is easier then working on issues such as simplification and clarity. </li>
					<li> Enables author creativity. Ideally an author could create any interface that they wish, but by enabling API's and personalization, our user groups can receive an adapted interface that is suitable for their needs. </li>
					<li> Better accessibility and inclusion. Sometimes, especially with these user groups, user needs can conflict. With adaptability and personalization the interface is personalized to the individuals user needs. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>See the discussion on personalization below. </p>

<p>This section identifies the different needs of the community and proposes suggestions on how standards and technologies could be developed to meet these needs. This section is designed for standards’ groups and policy makers.
Each section addresses a different group of related user needs. Related user needs have been grouped together to help define a coherent solution space.
It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
<a id="userneeds"></a><strong>Tables of user needs:</strong> each  table addresses a group of user needs. The tables show how related user needs can be met. 
<ul>
  <li>Each row starts, in the first column, with user needs to be addressed.</li>
  <li><a id="WCAGex"></a>The second column in each row describes how user needs could be addressed in the next version of the WCAG. It gives the names of the relevant success criteria proposals.

  <li><a id="authoring"></a>The third column describes examples of authoring techniques that may support user needs or WCAG success criteria. See the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/techniques/index.html">COGA authoring techniques document</a> or the appendix on making content accessible for people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
  <li><a id="semantics"></a> The fourth column describes new semantics that may be required to address user needs, such as extra ARIA attributes.

				<h3 id="table1"><bdi class="secno">3.1 </bdi>Topic 1: Authentication and Safety<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#table1"></a></h3>
				<p><strong>About users:</strong> People with cognitive and learning disabilities may be not able use a Web site becuse they can not use the login or authenitification process.</p>
	
				<p>Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make transcribing text or remembering passwords difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between users and the tasks they are doing. For example, requiring remembering and/or transcribing passwords often bar users with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service. </p>
				<p>Many users without cognitive and learning disabilities find these tasks hard. However, when the user also has a disability such as a memory disability, these tasks are not just annoying but impossible, and they are prevented from using these services.</p> <p> For example, a person with an early stage of dementia may be able to check whether they have made a payment. (This is a task that is more important for people with memory impairment to ensure they do not double pay.) Their banking system requires long password and coping codes from the a phone to their laptop. Because they can not do these tasks they can not check their account. The result is often that people require a caregiver to help them and lose their autonomy years before it would otherwise be necessary.  </p>
	<p>This leads to the following user stories.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forgets passwords, I need to be able to use a site, without remembering or transcribing  passwords and user names, so I can use its service.</li>
					<li>As a user who has  impairments, I need to use a site without being required to transcribe items in the correct sequence.</li>
					<li>As a user who has weak executive function, I need the   login process to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.</li>
					<li>As a symbol user, I  need a login process I can use.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>About users: Completing forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most users with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia, or attention related disabilities. Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make transcribing text difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Many  users with learning disabilities cannot  remember numbers, such as those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many users even need  to  check their phone numbers. This makes  entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks.</p>
				<p>Many users find it very difficult to transcribe information due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a user who needs to look up my       postal/zip code, I do not want a session       to time out while I try  to find the information needed.</li>
                  <li>As a user who needs to take  breaks during       tasks, such as completing a form,       I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer       crashes. I do       not want to have to start over again, which can create a cycle of reentering my data; and making me more tired and more likely to make       mistakes.</li>
                  <li>As a user with difficulty typing       numbers in the right order,       I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
                  <li>As a user who finds entering       information stressful, I want to enter as little       information as I can so the task is more manageable.</li>
                </ul>
<p><strong>User Needs</strong></p>
			  <ul>
					<li>I need help avoiding mistakes, and minimizing the mistakes I might make. </li>
					<li>I need to know what mistake I made, and how to correct a mistake. It does not scare me I if I can make the correction easily. </li>
					<li>I need enough time, and  not lose my work. </li>
					<li>I want to use applications or APIs that remember a lot of my information so I do not need to enter it again, and to otherwise help me, such as with spelling. </li>
					<li>I want to know where I am in a process, including what I have done and what my next step is. </li>

				<p><strong>About users:</strong> many users cannot easily learn new design metaphors, or remember things they learned, such as users with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate desired items to interact with, and to know what interactions may do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed. </p>
				<p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols are key to being able to use the web for users who cannot remember new symbols (such as some users with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore, users need things to be familiar including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>location of elements;</li>
					<li>symbols; </li>
					<li>text used;</li>
					<li>how to get help.</li>
				</ul>
  <p>However, what is familiar for one user may be new for another. So, the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user.</p>
				<p>This leads to the following user stories: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>I am familiar with the UI, and I know how to work it and what will happen when I work it. </li>
				  <li>Content delivered in an easy-to-understand mode. </li>
				  <li>Simple content with few options and consistent text . </li>

              <p>About  users: Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues and/or language issues that can make remembering numbers, while  processing words, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include  impaired executive function. </p>
              <p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between users and the task they are doing so users cannot use the content or service.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Voice XML enables  voice dialog systems and voice browsers. Sometimes users need to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in their  minds, such as a number being  presented as an option, while processing terms that follow.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This leads to the following user stories.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills, I want to get help, without going though a Voice-ML menu system, so I can set an appointment or find out some information.</li>
                <li>As a user who has weak executive       function, I need a process to get help       to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.</li>
                <li>Users can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>
              </ol>

					<ol>
						<li>All user information must be kept safe, to the fullest extent possible. Any clues that the user has cognitive disabilities (such as a request for a simplified version) should be protected information.</li>
						<li>Security should be strong AND easily used by those with cognitive disabilities, such as a biometrics option. For a full discussion see the section on security.</li>
						<li>Personalization systems can be designed so that any information implying vulnerabilities are on the user device and are secure. Use of functional requirements can also be a safer alternative to describing user needs in systems such as meta-data. Other systems are addressing this issue and further work should include looking at existing solutions.</li>
						<li>A site with a chat option should prevent any exchange of personal information. </li>
						<li> Users should be regularly warned to avoid scams. </li>
						<li> Getting help and /or reporting something worrying should be extremely easy to do. Users should know they will never be penalized for reporting something. </li>
						<li> Users should find it easy to report to the cyber crime fighters in their jurisdiction. </li>
						<li> Provide easy to use videos and tips that provide explanations about cyber criminals, how to stay safe, and how to report anything you find odd. </li>
						<li> Server side solutions can be employed for finding cyber-criminals, such as analytics. </li>
						<li> Advertisements and paid articles should be vetted for reliability. They should be clearly marked as external content in an easy to understand way. </li>
						<li> Users should be made aware when they are leaving your site or going to a less trustworthy site, including when following links they have been given by users. </li>
						<li> Sites offering sexual content or intended for chats of sexual nature should state that clearly. </li>

				<p>Text, which comprises the vast majority of content on the Web, is difficult to understand by many people (most COGA groups). </p>
				<p>Also, use cases include: </p>
				<ol>
					<li> Jumping to the relevant part of content (This is typically not supported, making content less usable.) </li>
					<li> Finding pieces in the content once focus is lost </li>
					<li> Going back a step when something was not understood </li>
					<li> Going back and forth between where a term was explained and the content of focus</li>
					<li> Multi-modal supplements can aid understanding - such as visual maps and spider diagrams</li>

					<p>Text can be made easier to understand when delivered in different modes. Ideally, people should be able to choose that content is delivered in the mode they comprehend best, such as: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> Text To Speech </li>
						<li> Video </li>
						<li> Text With Contextually-Relevant Images </li>
						<li> Text with Consistent Icons and Graphics </li>
						<li> Text Replaced or Augmented by Symbol Sets </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Further, video and audio should be navigable, such as: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Having the content structured such that it is clearly identified or signposted (e.g., with a slide that says "step two - remove the old washer" or "step three - put on the new washer") </li>
						<li> The structure is navigable (e.g., a person can jump directly to step two) </li>
						<li> Keywords are identified, and can be jumped to directly </li>
						<li> Enabling bookmarks and annotations (that can be navigated) </li>

				 This summary pulls together a few different issue papers and addresses them together. They are: 
				<ul>
					<li> User Preferences </li>
					<li> Adaptable Links and Buttons </li>
					<li> Symbols for Non-Verbal </li>
					<li> Personalization </li>
					<li> Providing graded help </li>
					<li> Interoperable preference </li>
					<li> (meta data support - to be added) </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Full versions can be found from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.</p>
				<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the preferences or needs of the user. Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements (needs). </p>
				<p>We need personalization because: </p>
				<ol>
					<li> Different user needs can conflict. </li>
					<li> Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them. </li>
					<li> Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it. </li>
					<li> Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often be considered boring design. </li>
					<li> Ability to change levels of complexity (increase or decrease) - As  the person's skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
					<li> Enable content providers to really meet the user needs. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>For example, using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web for people who can not remember new symbols (such as some people with memory related impairments like dementia). However, what is familiar for one user may be new for another. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the design and icons simple and familiar. </p>

					<p>Typical configurable features include adjustments such as colors, text and icon size, sounds or mouse double click speed. Current preferences tend to focus on physical needs that help the user use the content and not on cognitive needs and preferences that help the user understand the content. Meta data and ontologies for preferences also currently focus on physical accessibility needs. For our purposes we need the ontologies to support issues such as: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Types of Language support – such as non-literal language or simple language </li>
						<li> Types of Help available </li>
						<li> Types of graphics and symbols </li>
						<li> API and add on compatibility, such as to help with filling forms or passwords </li>
						<li> Adaptable controls for simple and know interfaces </li>
						<li> Simplified content with less options </li>
						<li> Features to help the user keep and restore context </li>

					<h5 id="b-6-1-2-setting-and-gathering-preferences"><bdi class="secno">B.6.1.2 </bdi>Setting and Gathering Preferences<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#setting-and-gathering-preferences"></a></h5>
					<p>People with cognitive disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to select their desired preferences. Indeed depending on the individual and the technology being used it may be impossible with a supporter's assistance. </p>
					<p>So specific problems for people with cognitive disabilities include: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Too many settings and/or options for each </li>
						<li> Not knowing what their preferences are in terms of the available technical solutions </li>
						<li> Not being aware of possible solutions </li>
					</ol>
					<p>The use of custom templates of default  preferences for particular groups of users is one method . Selection a base to immediately provided  useful settings  across a wide range of products and services as a starting point. </p>
					<p>Inferring Preferences is one solution but the technology is not yet mature. Another issue is <strong>multiple devices and applications</strong>. </p>
					<p>There is also a significant risk that, if done badly, <strong>user information and vulnerabilities </strong>can be exposed, exposing the most vulnerable users at the greatest risk. </p>
					<p><strong>Interoperable personalization schemes</strong>. Interoperable personalization schemes are where users want or need products and services to be personalized, they would prefer or need this to happen across the widest possible range of products or services. Personalization schemes that deliver this ideal will only succeed if they are standardized and if that standard is adopted by the widest range of product and service providers. However there are many critical issues for any personalization scheme to resolve such as funding and adoption. </p>
					<p>Current works in progress are [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-gpii" title="The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure">GPII</a></cite>] (See [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-gpii" title="The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure">GPII</a></cite>] which is compatible with ISO/IEC 24751) and [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi" title="The European Telecommunications Standards Institute">ETSI</a></cite>] (see [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-eg-202-325" title="Human Factors (HF); User Profile Management">ETSI-EG-202-325</a></cite>],[<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-es-202-746" title="Human Factors (HF); Personalization and User Profile Management; User Profile Preferences and Information">ETSI-ES-202-746</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-es-202-642" title="Human Factors (HF); Personalization of eHealth systems by using eHealth user profiles (eHealth)">ETSI-ES-202-642</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-ts-102-747" title="Human Factors (HF); Personalization and User Profile Management; Architectural Framework">ETSI-TS-102-747</a></cite>]  ) </p>
					<p><br>
		            Another issue is <strong>Contextual personalization</strong> which includes optimizing the personalization of a product or service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current context of use. For example, settings that will suit the user of a mobile phone in their office or home will not be well suited to that user when they are driving a car. </p>
					<p>Metadata is another related topic. Metadata allows the user to find content that they can use and suites their personal needs and preferences. A lot of work has been done for enabling metadata that helps people with physical disabilities find versions of content that they can use. However the semantics and terms do not support the specific requirements of people with different cognitive disabilities. </p>

					<ol>
						<li>Promote and support advancements in technologies in these area.

					<p>We need standardized terms and supportive syntax that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for the individual use, possibly via an aria attribute and personal preferences. </p>
					<p>For example, assume an author can make it programmatically known that a button is used to send an email. At the user end, the button could be rendered with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that are understandable for this particular user. It could automatically integrate with F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. </p>
					<p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice with user preferences are available Full versions can be found from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>. It demonstrates personalization for any use - including people with learning and memory issues </p>
					
					<p>It is made of 4 parts: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> JSON files for user setting: </li>
						<li> Aria proposal for new syntax: Adaptable Links and Buttons </li>
						<li> An HTML page that uses some of the new aria syntax: </li>
						<li> Scripts that a web author can use or include that read the user settings in the JSON files and adapt the page for the user needs. </li>
					</ol>
					<p>This is only one example way to use the semantics. Others may follow. It is also worth noting that the [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-gpii" title="The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure">GPII</a></cite>] project is working on making user preferences portable which would also enhance this work. </p>

					<p>Products  for people who are  non-verbal  often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples'  language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copyright AND  are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or content from a different company. If we enabled  mapping to open sets of symbol codes that, in turn, map to open or proprietary  symbol sets, then they can be interoperable. At the user end ,  the user agent can load the symbols that the user knows. Symbol   sets might still be proprietary but they  would also be interoperable. That means the end  user  could use them across different devices, or any compatible content  or applications. </p>
<p>Our members are working on projects to enable interoperable symbol sets and the semantics that would enable it. Such as (Pseudocode): </p>

					<p>This will require </p>
					<ul>

					<p>Voice menu systems and Voice XML are used to develop audio and voice response applications similar to automated telephone menu systems. These systems can cause issues for people with cognitive disabilities who may not have the reasoning skills to understand the instructions or have trouble processing the instructions quickly enough while listening to an array of options to choose from. A person with a cognitive disability may have trouble with short-term memory resulting in the inability to remember the number or verbal response required by the application, or may take a longer period of time to verbalize or enter in a response. </p>

					<p>People with various cognitive impairments can have a variety of difficulties with the online payment systems used in e-commerce. These difficulties range from having trouble understanding the instructions and process to be followed to complete a transaction to issues in providing the necessary personal and financial information to make an online payment. If an online payment system requires a lot of user input for required information, the presentation of the input fields could cause a cluttered look, which can be distracting and make it difficult for the user to process the steps to take to complete the transaction, adding to their frustration and stress. If the online payment system has voiced commands, persons with speech perception issues may not be able to fully understand the instructions to respond appropriately. </p>

					<p>The solutions are split into five categories as follows: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> Navigation <ul>
								<li> Standardize any controls, features and navigation in the online payment system for consistency. </li>
								<li> Keep menus short with clear labels and signs. </li>
								<li> Provide ways to navigate back step-by-step or start over. </li>
								<li> Provide prompts and feedback on the user's progress, give appropriate help when an error is encountered. </li>
								<li> Limit the number of options to lower cognitive overload. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Functionality <ul>
								<li> Use CSS to provide the user control of how information is presented, such as: font, font size, line height, spaces between lines of text, the size of click/touch areas, mouse-over highlighting of text, changes of background and text colors. </li>
								<li> Provide user with list of information they need to have ready prior to using the web payment system. </li>
								<li> Provide definitions and explanations for technical terms, acronyms, etc. used by the web payment system. </li>
								<li> Keep alerts and feedback on the screen until the user explicitly dismisses them. </li>
								<li> Provide search capabilities tolerant of misspellings and typos. </li>
								<li> For users with low-literacy or processing impairments, include speaking text/narration. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Content and Text <ul>
								<li> Use plain language and short, concise sentences. </li>
								<li> Use appropriate graphics to enhance understanding. </li>
								<li> Place critical content "above the fold" to avoid scrolling, if possible. </li>
								<li> Use bulleted lists and a single idea per paragraph to make more digestible "chunks" of information. </li>
								<li> Provide meaningful headings. </li>
								<li> Avoid full justification of text (left and right margins) which can cause large white areas between words. </li>
								<li> The line length of text should be less than 70-80 characters. </li>
								<li> Avoid the use of non-literal text and colloquialisms in the text. </li>
								<li> For people with memory limitations, reduce the standard 7 ± 2 elements per screen to 4 ± 2. </li>
								<li> Provide the ability for the user to request longer or shorter content to either increase or decrease details provided. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Layout <ul>
								<li> Use a consistent layout for each page or step in the web payment system. </li>
								<li> Streamline the page and reduce any extra information not key to completing the web transaction. </li>
								<li> Use plenty of white space for an uncluttered look </li>
								<li> Highlight urgent or important information to be easier to find. </li>
								<li> Avoid menus that appear or disappear with mouse hover and text that moves or changes. </li>
								<li> Use high contrast between text and the background. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Multimedia <ul>
								<li> As applicable, use typical accessibility techniques: captions, audio description, subtitles. </li>
								<li> Use sounds to enhance the visual experience, such as auditory feedback to signal a change of state or completion of an action. </li>
								<li> Avoid animated graphics which can be distracting, or provide controls to allow the user to adjust the speed of the motion. </li>
								<li> Use graphics and icons as navigation aids, or to indicate progression through the steps for completing a web payment transaction. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>

					<p>People with cognitive impairments may experience multiple difficulties with devices that are part of the Internet of Things.  For example, some people may have trouble processing text and numbers. The test or symbols used may not be intuitive to the user.   Other people may have difficulty with auditory information, spatial orientation, or responding to prompts on devices before the prompts time out.  These types of difficulties could prohibit people with cognitive disabilities from operating smart devices that have impacts on their health and safety.</p>
