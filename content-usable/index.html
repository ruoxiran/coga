      	<p>This section is an easy to understand summary of the key points of this document. Also see <a href="#how-to-use-this-document">How to Use this Document</a>, for more orientation. To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities we have identified the following key topics:</p>
<div class="imagelist">
<section id="summary-understand">
<h3 id="help-users-understand-what-things-are-and-how-to-use-them">Help users understand what things are and how to use them.<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#summary-understand"></a></h3>
<p>Use icons, symbols, terms, and design patterns that are already familiar to users so that they do not have to learn new ones. People with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-2" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> often need common behavior and design patterns. For example, use the standard convention for hyperlinks (underlined and blue for unvisited; purple for visited).</p>

<h3 id="help-users-focus">Help users focus.<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#summary-focus"></a></h3>
<p>Avoid distracting the user from their tasks. If the user does get distracted, headings and breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. Providing linked breadcrumbs can help the user undo mistakes.</p>

<section id="summary-support"><h3 id="provide-help-and-support"> Provide help and support.<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#summary-support"></a></h3>
<p>This includes:
<strong>making it easy to get human help.</strong> If users have difficulty sending feedback, then you will never know if they are able to use the content or when they are experiencing problems. In addition,
<strong>support different ways to understand content.</strong> Graphics, summaries of long documents, adding icons to headings and links, and alternatives for numbers are all examples of extra help and support.</p>

      <h2 id="x2-introduction"><bdi class="secno">2. </bdi>Introduction<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#introduction_for_usable"></a></h2>

      <p>
        Making web sites and applications usable by people with
        cognitive and learning disabilities affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, accessibility focused on making the interface usable for
		people with sensory and physical impairments (vision, hearing, or mobility).
		Some accessibility features will help people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-5" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.
		Often the issues that affect people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-6" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>
		include:</p>
    <ul><li> design,</li>
    <li>context, </li>
    <li>structure, </li>
    <li>language, </li>
    <li>usability, and</li>
    <li>other factors that are difficult to include in general guidelines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         Some common designs create barriers for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.  The patterns presented in this
		 document have been designed to avoid such barriers for people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-7" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.
		 While this guidance may improve usability for all, these patterns are essential for some people with cognitive
		 and learning impairments to be able to use content independently.
      </p>
	  <p>The objectives and patterns build on the:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-user-research/">Cognitive Accessibility User Research</a>,</li>
        <li>  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/">Cognitive Accessibility Issue Papers</a>, and</li>
        <li>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-gap-analysis/">Cognitive Accessibility Gap Analysis and Roadmap</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	  	  <p>

		 The objectives and patterns presented here provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">supplemental guidance</a>
		 beyond the requirements of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2">WCAG</a>. Following this guidance is not required for conformance to WCAG. They address accessibility barriers that were not included in the current normative WCAG 2.x and may not otherwise be addressed.</p>

		 <p>Following the advice in this document, as much as possible, will be particularly valuable for web content and applications that address:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>individual safety concerns,</li>
			<li>health,</li>
			<li>critical services,</li>
			<li>autonomy,</li>
			<li>caregiving,</li>
			<li>social integration, and</li>
			<li>work and the workplace.</li>
		</ul>

	  <p> Note that people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-8" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may also
have other impairments such as motor disabilities or visual
impairments. For
example, some people with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-1" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age related forgetfulness</a> may also require
higher contrast. It is always important to follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag22" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2">WCAG22</a></cite>] and ensure the
needs
of all disabilities are addressed.</p>

		<p>This document provides information on the development process and design options for making web sites and applications more usable and accessible for people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-9" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.</p>
		<p>It is organized by high level objectives which are listed along with user stories in <a href="#user_needs">section 3</a>. </p>

		<p>The high-level objectives outline key design goals that will help people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Each objective has associated:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>user needs and user stories, that show the user perspective,</li>
			<li>design patterns, that show what to do,</li>
			<li>personas with user scenarios, that help you to understand your users' experiences and challenges, and</li>
			<li>questions for user testing. </li>

		</ul>
		<p>Mappings of objectives, user stories, patterns and personas are available in <a href="#appendix-mapping-user-needs-personas-and-patterns">Appendix A</a>. This provides a way to understand how to address the objective and why it is important. Some people may prefer to start with Appendix A. </p>
		<p>This document is divided into parts. Each part can be used in different ways in the product development life cycle. This will help teams achieve the objectives in this document without significantly changing the way they work. </p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#user_needs">Section 3. User Stories</a>: This section contains user stories for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Each story includes related user needs. Teams may use these in different ways. For example, teams can:
					<ul><li>incorporate them into user stories, or</li>
						<li>use as part of user research to help you understand your users’ needs.</li>
					</ul>
			 </li>
			<li><a href="#design_for_everyone">Section 4. Design Guide</a>: This section contains design patterns that support the objectives. Patterns are provided with rationale, how-to guidance, and examples. Teams can use design patterns in different ways, for example:
				<ul>
					<li>incorporate them into requirement specifications,</li>
					<li>use in design guidelines,</li>
					<li>use as solutions when users are dropping out,</li>
					<li>use as inspiration for site design,</li>
					<li>test designs against “use” and “avoid” examples,</li>
					<li>include them in design libraries, and</li>
					<li>use as content guidelines to promote <a href="#dfn-easy-to-understand-language" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-easy-to-understand-language-1" title="Easy to Understand Language refers to text content that is in an accessible, easy to understand, form">easy to understand language</a> and communication.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li><a href="#Building_in_the_user">Section 5. Usability Testing, Focus Groups, and Feedback</a>: This section provides a brief introduction to including people with cognitive and learning disabilities in user research. It also includes test questions for each objective. Content from this section can, for example, help teams:
				<ul><li>involve people with cognitive and learning disabilities in user research and user testing,</li>
					<li>work with peer researchers,</li>
					<li>build the user into the development process, or</li>
					<li>incorporate guidance to support vulnerable users.</li>
				</ul>
			 </li>
			<li><a href="#persona">Section 6. Use Cases/ Personas</a>: This section provides personas that relate to the user stories, objectives, and design patterns presented in the rest of the document. These personas can be used in user research and developer education.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It should be noted that all teams should try to involve users with cognitive and learning disabilities throughout the design and development process. Teams that are too small for user testing and focus groups can find affordable ways to involve the user by reading <a href="#Building_in_the_user">Section 5</a>.</p>



		<section id="testing-each-pattern">
			<h4 id="x2-1-1-testing-each-pattern"><bdi class="secno">2.1.1 </bdi>Testing Each Pattern<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#testing-each-pattern"></a></h4>
			<p>In many cases the “use” and “avoid” examples for each pattern can be used as a testable case. The pattern is probably applied if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For each pattern, a “use” example is implemented (unless it is not relevant for the content).</li>
				<li>For each pattern, the items identified as “avoid” examples are avoided (unless they are necessary or essential). </li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are additional ongoing efforts to make testable statements for each design pattern with corresponding test processes and failure examples, that are always applicable. These are available at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Testable_Statements_for_Each_Pattern">Testable Statements for COGA Design Patterns</a>.</p>
			<p>In some cases, the testable statements only cover part of the design pattern. The Cognitive Accessibility Task Force intends to continue working on these statements as a supplement to the design guide.</p>
			<p>One can also test  that the additional advice in this document is integrated into development and design processes. For example: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Confirm that diverse users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-10" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> are included in the projects’ focus groups, research and user testing as per the advice in <a href="#Building_in_the_user">Section 5</a>.</li>
				<li>Confirm user needs and user stories for people with cognitive and learning disabilities are integrated into the project user needs, user stories, and requirements, as per <a href="#user_needs">Section 3</a>.</li>
				<li>Confirm that personas from <a href="#persona">Section 6</a> are integrated into the research phase of the project.</li>
				<li>Confirm that the project user tests include testing for the objectives in this document as per <a href="#Building_in_the_user">Section 5</a>.</li>

        <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#background"></a></h3>
        <p>Cognitive and learning disabilities include long-term, short-term, and permanent difficulties relating to cognitive functions, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>learning, communication, reading, writing, or math,</li>
				<li>ability to understand or process new or complex information and learn new skills, with a reduced ability to cope independently, and / or</li>
				<li>memory and attention or visual, language, or numerical thinking.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
          Design, structure, and language choices can make content inaccessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Examples may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People with impaired short-term memory may be unable to recall passwords or copy access codes. They may have trouble or be unable to remember new icons and interface paradigms.
          </li>
		  <li>
			People with impaired working memory may only be able to hold one to three items in their memory at the same time. This can make it difficult to hold information temporarily or copy access codes.
		  </li>
          <li>
            People with different processing speed capabilities may need additional time to understand the design relationships and information on the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            People with language related disabilities may need simple clear language and instructions. Some may rely on supporting graphics, icons, and familiar symbols to understand content.
          </li>
          <li>
            People with social or communication disabilities may need clear literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal text and new icons.
          </li>
          <li>
            People with impairments that affect the comprehension of mathematical concepts may not understand  or confuse numerical references such as percentages.
          </li>
          <li>
            People who have issues with keeping or regaining focus may have difficulty completing a simple task if there are a lot of distractions and interruptions. They may need headers and signposts to help them regain the context after their attention was lost (including in multimedia).
          </li>
          <li>
          	People with cognitive and learning disabilities that impact learning may need more support or time to complete a new process or an authentication task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many groups may struggle with cognitive fatigue when completing complex, multi-stage processes such as filling out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content or feature that they need. They will need support to minimize errors and complete their task.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These difficulties may sometimes also be experienced by the general population due to environmental or situational barriers. For example, when they are trying to use a web site when distracted or stressed. Working on a mobile device while in an unfamiliar or noisy situation can also place an additional cognitive load on users by splitting their attention. However, for users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-12" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>, these difficulties are likely to be persistent and significant. As a result, they may be unable to access content and complete these tasks independently.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-13" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">Cognitive and learning disabilities</a> are difficult to diagnose and categorize. They are usually hidden and can be age related.  Users are less likely to have a formal diagnosis of a disability than individuals with physical and sensory difficulties. Often, only some functions are impaired while other cognitive functions are unaffected. For example, someone with dyslexia may be a fantastic engineer. Sometimes, cognitive and learning disabilities may include intellectual impairments that affect comprehension, alongside written and spoken expression. People may also experience more than one type of cognitive and learning disability. Note that the terminology and definitions used for cognitive and learning disabilities varies between countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other groups who will benefit include:</p>
 <ul><li>people with <a href="#dfn-mental-health" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-mental-health-1" title="May include: mental heath impairments">mental health</a> issues that cause cognitive difficulties,

          Some aspects of making web content and applications usable by

          people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-14" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> should be dealt with as part of the
          overall design process. Most organizations should include scope
          for a user-centered design process. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Developer_resources">our developer resource page</a> for related resources.

        </p>
        <p>
          Key parts of this process for people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-15" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> should be:

	  <p> The objectives and patterns presented here provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">supplemental guidance</a> beyond the requirements of The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag22" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2">WCAG22</a></cite>]. They are intended to address barriers that could not be included in the normative WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag22" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2">WCAG22</a></cite>] specification and may not otherwise be addressed. </p>

      <p>
      	This guide is divided into design objectives. An outline of these objectives can also be found in the <a href="#summary">summary section</a>.

      <p>
	   Each objective contains a number of practical patterns (repeated designs for controls and other elements) that describe what to do to address user needs.

They can also struggle or be unable to learn new design patterns. Make controls, icons and elements simple and conventional to help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make it clear to users what things are and how to use them. This includes clearly indicating the purpose of:
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>a site,</li>
      	<li>section of a site, </li>

      <p>
        Use headers, labels, and other signposts to help users know the purpose of the page, region, or control.

      <p>Help users understand how to use controls and elements on each page. </p>
      <p>
      	Use familiar design patterns, terms, and icons to help users who struggle to remember new designs. Ensure the look, location, and interaction of controls and other elements are familiar and consistent across the site.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Show a clear relationship between controls and the content they effect to help users understand the effect of possible actions and reduce potential confusion.

          <p>
            This helps many people, including those with impaired memory and attention as well as anyone who is easily distracted due to <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-2" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a> and <a href="#dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d-1" title="Attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or AD(H)D involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted">AD(H)D</a>.

          <p>
            For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping. They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they have forgotten what they were doing. A clear heading at the top of each page shows clearly <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.

          Use common designs that are familiar to most users. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li>design elements, </li>
        	<li>affordances (visual hints about how to a control),</li>
        	<li>patterns, and</li>

          <p>
            Many users cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate desired items with which to interact, and to know what interactions may do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are more likely to find and recognize common design elements that are repeated often over a long period of use, across many sites.
          </p>
		  <p>
		  For example, a user with a <a href="#dfn-mild-cognitive-impairment-mci" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-mild-cognitive-impairment-mci-1" title="Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can involve problems with memory, language, thinking, and judgment that are greater than normal age-related challenges">mild cognitive impairment</a> or dementia, goes to a site to buy a product. They cannot find where to pay for the item that they want. They may think the site does not allow shopping and the site just provides information.

          <p>Common design elements, affordances, and patterns include:</p>
          <ul>
			 <li>
              A standard layout and visual hierarchy (arrangement of elements to show the order of importance). Place elements where the user is expecting them. For example, in an English site:
              <ul>
                <li>
                 search in the top right hand corner in a web site,
                </li>
                <li>
                  link to the home page in the top left hand corner,
                </li>
                <li>link to “contact us” in the top navigation area,</li>
                <li>link to the site map in the footer area, and</li>
                <li>submit button at the bottom of a form.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Common design patterns (repeated designs for controls and other elements), such as:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  WAI-ARIA authoring best practices [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wai-aria-practices-1.2" title="WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2">wai-aria-practices-1.2</a></cite>],

            When designing web pages, select standard components that look and behave the way users expect. Use standard conventions for layout such as:

            		home link in the upper left corner,

          <p>Many users take a long time to learn new designs and recognize elements. Once learned, the elements should be used throughout the site. </p>
          <p>
            For example, an older user with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-3" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a> takes a long time to learn new designs. When they come to a site, the first page takes time to understand, but then they know what to do on the next page. If the next page is different from the first and also difficult to learn, they become tired and make more mistakes. As they move to a third difficult page the cognitive load becomes too much and they cannot complete the task.

        <p> Provide breadcrumbs, a “how I got here” button, or heading to help the user orientate themselves inside a site or task. </p>
        <p>
          In a multi-step process, this includes showing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the steps completed, </li>
          <li>the current step,</li>

          <p>
            This pattern helps a user who loses focus, forget what they are doing or gets distracted reorient themselves to their current activity. Clearly indicating the current location and progress helps the user continue after they lose focus without reading a great deal of content or restarting.
          </p>
          <p>Providing information about the steps that need to complete a task helps users determine if they can successfully finish the task. This is especially important for users who often find processes difficult to complete.</p>

By seeing the bread crumbs they can remind themselves where they are and continue their task.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then needs to pick up where they left off.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with a processing difficulty is not sure if this application has too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are half-way through they can gauge if they can cope with the entire process.

        <p>Use a clear and recognizable design for controls. Make it clear what elements are controls and how to use them.</p>

		    <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using a common style on controls (for example, links being underlined).
          </li>
          <li>
            Using common design patterns on links and controls (for example, clicking on a link takes you to the page).
          </li>
          <li>
            Making the borders of controls clear. Links in text do not need borders if identified properly (for example, a help icon has a border).
          </li>
          <li>
            Making controls large enough so that users can click on it and not the item next to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring items that are not clickable do not look like links or controls.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When this is not possible, provide instructions that explain how to use the control. Instructions should be on the same page or one click away and written in <a href="#dfn-easy-to-understand-language" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-easy-to-understand-language-5" title="Easy to Understand Language refers to text content that is in an accessible, easy to understand, form">easy to understand language</a>.
        </p>

          </section><section id="how-it-helps-3"><h5 class="coga-5" id="x4-2-5-3-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">4.2.5.3 </bdi>How it Helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-3"></a></h5>
          <p>
            Controls are parts of web pages that do something, e.g. a link, button, checkbox. Common style and design patterns on controls are easier to recognize and understand how to use it.
		      </p>
        		<p>
        			The goal of these controls is to allow someone to use them. As soon as the user needs to discover the control or work out how to use it, some users will fail.
        		</p>

        		<p> For example, an older user with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-4" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a> takes longer to learn new designs. They go to an ecommerce site that has boxes around the headers such as “sale”. It also has simple large text for controls such as the “add to cart” button. The user clicks on the headings and not on the “add to cart” button (that looks like text). After a few failures they assume they cannot manage it and leave the site. </p>
          <p>
            Some users have trouble when controls have a different look, color, or shape than they have used before. For example, when links do not have underlines and blue or purple text some users will not know there is a link (even if this appears with focus).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have difficulty with memory, it can be harder to use unique controls. It may take longer to find controls on the page. Even if they work just a little differently than similar ones, some users may need to relearn how to use them each time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using typical controls on the page will help people know how to use them. When using more unique controls, include easy to follow instructions and make them easy to find. It should be easy to identify, understand, and use the controls, regardless of how a user uses the page (vision, auditory, voice input).

        <p>
          The relationship between controls and affected content should be completely clear and unambiguous.
        </p>
        <p>This can be achieved through:</p>
			<ul>
      <li>visually grouping controls with the content they relate to,</li>
			<li>including controls within the region they affect,</li>
			<li>using clear dividers or white space between regions in a page that may have separate controls or a scroll bar, </li>
      <li>avoiding multiple or nested scrolling areas.</li>
      </ul>

          <p>
            If a control on a page operates only on part of the page, it can be hard to tell what it will affect and what it will not. Users may try the wrong control. Many users will try again, and discover the correct control or scrollbar. However, many people with cognitive or learning disabilities may not be able to work out what to do. Others will feel cognitive overload, and stop as a result. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is too complicated for them. For these users, the application will not be usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clear borders and groupings on the page can help indicate what element the control effects. Having a border or other visual cue around the controls and the relevant section can help make it more understandable. Check with user testing that users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-23" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> find all the page relationships clear and quickly know how to use the controls. Testing is essential when the controls cannot be in the area they affect.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, consider a user living with dementia trying to work out which scrollbar to use for embedded scrollable regions. When they try the wrong scrollbar, they do not get the effect they desire and their content may seem to disappear.

	          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Separate Interactive Elements</strong>. For example: Do not have two scroll bars close together. Some users may find it difficult to determine which one to use with a particular section of content. Instead: <ul>
                <li>
                  use clear visual layout and placement of the scroll bars,
                </li>
                <li>
                  break the content into two separate pages, or
                </li>
                <li>
                  consider removing unnecessary information from the page.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Associate elements and their controls</strong>. Place interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can impact. Keep interactive elements further from content to which they do not apply. This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact each section of content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use dividers</strong>. Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</li>
      			<li>
      			<strong>Help the user see the right control</strong>. Use large clear buttons and scroll bars.
      			</li>
          </ul>

              <ul>
                <li> On a library site, a search box for the whole site is located in the upper right of the site’s main navigation. A second search box searches the library catalog. It is located within a section with a clear border, different background color, and a heading “Library Catalog”. The go button reads “search catalog”. </li>
                <li>A page needs a scrollbar for one section. The scrollbar look like it is inside the section.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <ol>

            <li>Controls for one section that look like they might affect the whole page or another section. For example: The search box relates to one area of a page, and not for another area. It is unclear which area the search is for.</li>
            <li>Multiple nested scrolling regions.</li>

          <p>
            People who have language comprehension, learning, or reading difficulties may rely on symbols to understand content and navigate to content they need. Symbols also help people who struggle with language and attention to navigate content, including media.
		      </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with aphasia, has the intellectual ability to understand concepts, but struggles with language. They may be dependent on the use of symbols to browse pages for information.
          </p>
          <p>
           It can also help the elderly population who can find cluttered pages with dense text hard to read on a screen. Clear symbols, icons, and images that act as signposts to the text content can be very helpful.

            <p>Make it easy to understand and use the site hierarchy and the menu structure.</p>
            <p>This includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Think about the topics covered in your content. Then organize the site into logical, cohesive sections.</li>
              <li>Use the site organization in the main menu structure.</li>
              <li>Create sub-menu items that are clearly and logically associated with the main menu items under which they fall. It should be easy to know that sub-menu items are there and how to get to them. Users should guess correctly, the first time, where to find sub menu items.</li>

              <p>Users often become confused and lost when they do not understand the visual hierarchy of the site, menus, and structure. Clear sub-menus and a well-defined structure will help the user know what is on the site and how to find it.</p>
              <p>Users often are confused when:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>organization is unclear,</li>
              <li>menu terms are hard to understand, and</li>
              <li>menus and sub-menus are hard to find.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Dividing the site into clear logical sections can help. Make sections clear and subsections easy to find. Make the category structure and headings easy to understand. Create an outline that could serve as a summary of what is on the site.</p>
              <p>The terms used in the menu need to make sense to the user. It needs to be obvious to the user what category the page they are looking for would fall under. Using common words that are familiar to the user is very important.</p>
              <p>Make the levels in the content hierarchy easy to perceive and understand. Minimal type size or type weight differences or color differences may not be perceived or understood. Hierarchy solely dependent on small unique design elements creates confusion.</p>
              <p>For example, a drop down accordion menu of additional sub-menu items may not be viewable without understanding it needs to be clicked (or “rolled over”) as indicated by a small unique design element.</p>
              <p>When opening a web page for the first time, the sub-menus are typically collapsed. Some designs may make it difficult to know that there are sub-menus. Some users with cognitive disabilities may not guess that sub-menus are present. Even if they see a menu expand by accident, they may not generalize that this structure may be present for other items in a menu. Making it easy to notice that there are sub-menu items by adding a visual indicator to ensure users can use all of the site.</p>
              <p>There are times when opening the sub-menu item may not be easy for some people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-26" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. For example, the control to expand a menu item relies on a particular gesture or way of rolling over the area with a mouse. The end user may not figure out how to expand the sub-menu and may abandon the task. For example, a menu that expands only after moving the mouse over a particular side of the menu text.</p>

          <p>People with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-27" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may not be able to use content and applications when the page structure and relationships are unclear. The user may not complete tasks and miss key information. The user may not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand.</p>

          <p>Clear, well organized page layouts enable users to easily find key information. They can focus on their tasks instead of working out what is on the page. Using a standard visual layout, and positioning elements consistently, will help users rely on muscle memory and use them. This supports people with disabilities that impact their problem solving skills, slow readers, or people who get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of text. This includes:</p>
          <p><strong>A good structure:</strong> Organization of page content into sections, each with an obvious purpose, allows users to more easily locate and focus on the sections they need. Content that is not directly relevant to the main purpose of a page should be distinctly separated.</p>
          <p><strong>Use borders and shading to group:</strong> Grouping information using a border or color shading makes it easier for people to identify groups.</p>

          <p>For example: </p>
          <img alt="3 rows of 8 evenly spaced circles divided into two blue rectangles.  The blue backgrounds make the two groupings visually apparent." src="img/common-region-1.png">
          <img alt="4 circles divided into two sets of two by a contrasting border. Each set has a blue and a white circle. The white circles are adjacent but border clearly indicates the sets." src="img/common-region-2.png">
          <p>Figure: Example of grouping with shading and borders.</p>
          <p><strong>Visual cues:</strong> People who have difficulty recognizing or comprehending written language or concentrating, can find graphical cues easier to process.  Examples of common graphical indicators and visual cues include:</p>
            <ul><li>grouping summaries of content, </li>
            <li>using a card design using colors or white space, </li>
            <li>flagging important information, such as using call out boxes, and </li>
            <li>indicating different types of information, such as placing quotes in speech bubbles.
            </li></ul>

            <p>If pages have a lot of content, check that content is grouped and you can see what is related.</p>
            <p>Making regions and a clear page structure can include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clearly label content categories, and use familiar visual cues and icons. This will help recognition and retrieval rather than rely on memory. The background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</li>
              <li>The heading structure should create an outline of the document that could serve as an abstract of the whole document.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Icons should be used consistently. It is also important the graphical indicators do not clutter the interface. Too many icons can add to the cognitive load for users to process. Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</p>

              <li>Lack of visually differentiated sections.</li>
              <li>Sections without headings or icons that define sections. For example: A web page has chunks of content run into each other with a “flat design”. Many users with cognitive disabilities will find it challenging or impossible to work out which chunks belong together. Thus, all the benefits of chunking content are lost. </li>
            <li>Groups and page sections that are not logical.</li>

          <p>Slow readers, people with impaired <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-11" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a>, impaired memory, and other <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-28" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may not be able to find the information and features on a page. For example, content that requires a lot of reading or the use of the scroll bar or pointer hovers may be hard to find.  Other users cannot find content that requires paging through different screens </p>
          <p>Users who are unfamiliar with the page (or common design patterns) may rely on prominent visual styling aids to find important information. A clear heading structure can also help with this by reducing what needs to be read.</p>
          <p>For example, an elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with stories, activities,   and important announcements. One important announcement is that school will end early one day. The newsletter has less important information before the early school dismissal, and does not have a warning symbol next to the important information. A parent who reads slowly may need to stop before the important information and does not find out that the school is ending early one day. The parent is not home for the child on time.</p>
          <p>In another example, a user is writing a comment, but the send button is not visible when the focus is on the text area. As a result, she cannot see how to send her feedback. The company will then not receive any feedback from groups who unable to find the feedback button.</p>

          <p>The amount of page visible before scrolling is dependent on a wide range of factors such as physical device size and resolution. Where possible, use site statistics to understand what technology users are using. Keep this in mind when designing the page.</p>
          <p>Consider the most constrained user experience first (e.g., a 240px wide mobile phone) and then design upwards from there. This will account for the widest range of scenarios. Adopting responsive development practices can improve the flexibility of the page for more devices and situations.</p>

          <p>
            Make it easy to find the most important things on the page. Identify
            key content and its placement early in the design process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Space at the top of the document is most likely to be visible to
            users without scrolling. Place key content at the top of the page to give the best experience to the widest range of users.

          <p>Using a clear, logical structure, with headings allows users to orient and navigate through the content easily even if they get distracted or lose focus. This is particularly important for people with an attention impairment.</p>
          <p>Providing short logical segments help users find and focus on a specific topic. If the user loses concentration they can find their place in the material and start again from the last point that they remember. This is especially important for educational content or instructions.</p>
          <p>Chunking media also allows for each segment to be given a unique URI. It can then be easily referenced and shared.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some videos can be naturally organized into chapters or segments.</li>
            <li>A podcast can be split into segments rather than a single one-hour recording.</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Having a search capability allows users to find the content they need even if they cannot use the site menus. A user can learn how to use search and reuse that skill on many sites.</p>
            <p>Menu systems and most site navigation require the user to understand the menu categories. Users with impaired <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-12" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a> may be unable to identify the correct categories.</p>
            <p>In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather than logic. For example, most users remember that the print function is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may not be able to find these menu items based on recall.</p>
            <p>Users with impaired short-term memory, <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-5" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age related forgetfulness</a>, or who are easily distracted may also find navigating a site and going to many pages to look for content difficult. If it takes too long they may lose focus and forget what they are looking for.</p>
            <p>Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds appropriate or related content, and provides suggested auto-corrected versions of the search terms.</p>
            <p>If there are many results from related topics, it helps if search results are presented under the appropriate heading and categories. This helps the user find the search results they are looking for.</p>

          <p>This benefits many people such as those with language impairments, processing difficulties, or a memory impairment. Using uncommon words can make text and media difficult to understand.</p>
          <p>People with language impairments often have a reduced vocabulary. Learning new terms is a very slow, difficult process. For other groups, such as people living with dementia, learning new terms is not realistic or possible. Using uncommon words, that they do not already know, will make the content incomprehensible (unable to be understood) and unusable.</p>
          <p>For example, someone with mild dementia is trying to turn on an ICT heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat or air conditioning is labeled “mode”. The user cannot use the whole unit because of this one term. This type of design has caused emergencies such as hypothermia.</p>
          <p>Using common words and terms, with their most common meanings will help avoid these problems.</p>

          <p>Using simple tense and voice benefits many people such as people with language impairments, dyslexia, or a memory impairment. For example, more people will understand “press the on button” (present tense and active voice) than “the on button should be pressed.” (passive voice).</p>
          <p>Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to take action. For example, “It must be done.” is passive voice ad does not say who must act. “You must do it.” is active voice and clearly states who has the action.</p>
          <p>Putting the aim of the sentence at the beginning can also make English sentences easier to follow. Local language experts may have additional linguistic advice that helps make content easy to understand.</p>

          <p>Chunking text content makes it easier to read and understand. This helps people with learning or cognitive disabilities related to processing speed or language. People with a memory impairment or anyone who is easily distracted will also benefit. Chunking is also helpful to anyone who is multitasking. Try to put the aim or purpose at the beginning of each chunk or paragraph.</p>
          <p>For example, a graduate student with <a href="#dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d-3" title="Attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or AD(H)D involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted">AD(H)D</a> may need to teach themselves a new software skill. The software documentation is broken up into short paragraphs and lists by topic. The student finds the documentation easy to read and understand.</p>

            <li><strong>What is a short paragraph? </strong>In English, if you have a paragraph of more than 50 words, try breaking it up into two paragraphs.</li>
            <li><strong>How can I avoid writing a sentence with more than one point? </strong>Sentences that have more than one point usually have more than one linking word such as “and” or “but”.</li>
            <li><strong>Can a long sentence ever be clearer than two short sentences? </strong>Double-check if a long sentence is clearer than two short sentences. Do usability testing to see if people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-29" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> find the long sentence easier to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>When should I use lists? </strong>Lists are great when you have three or more things in a row. Think about using an unordered list (with bullet points) for items, requirements, and exceptions. A series of three or more steps is easier to follow as a numbered list.</li>

          Use punctuation and format for text, numbers, and symbols that reduce ambiguity and improve

            <p>For some readers, decoding words, numbers, and symbols does not happen automatically and can be demanding on working memory and <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-13" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive functions</a>. If they find content too demanding they are at risk of losing its meaning.</p>
            <p>Some users may use assistive technology or personalization tools to help understand content such as text-to-speech that reads aloud the content. However, sometimes the punctuation or format makes it more likely that the screen reader will read it incorrectly. For example, Roman numerals may be read as text.</p>
            <p>A user with a learning disability may be unable to manipulate letters, numbers, and words to correct mistakes that occur because of formatting or punctuation errors. They also need to focus on understanding the meaning of the content in order to use it.</p>
            <p>For example, a user with a communication disability may listen to content using text-to-speech. If the content is phrased correctly, they can understand it. Sometimes they hear content read incorrectly or skipped, particularly numbers and symbols, and they cannot understand it. If text, numbers or symbols are in an unfamiliar layout, the user may become confused.</p>
            <p>In contrast, a blind person listening to the content, is likely to be able to figure out the correct meaning even when words are not pronounced correctly. However, the word manipulations necessary to work out the correct meaning are not achievable by someone with a communications or language impairment.</p>

          <p><strong>Use language tags. </strong>Language tags are the key means to achieve the goal of unambiguous text formatting. See HTML [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-html" title="HTML Standard">HTML</a></cite>] language tags and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47 Language Codes</a>.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use punctuation correctly</strong> for the language you are
            writing in, as it will affect how the stress and intonation (known
            as prosody) patterns from the text are heard, when converted into
            speech. For example, in English, commas and semicolons will result
            in a short pause in the speech, whereas a hyphen - will generally be
            ignored. Question marks, exclamation marks, and speech marks can
            result in changes in intonation, such as a rise in the pitch of the
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avoid the use of Roman Numerals and unfamiliar symbols</strong>
            in text were possible. These can confuse readers and are likely to
            be read incorrectly by text-to-speech tools. If these symbols are
            necessary then ensure they are marked up correctly, using techniques
            such as MathML and abbreviation expansions to provide additional
            support. Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in
            isolation as they are likely to be read as individual letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Long numbers may be read as single digits or phrased as a single number. This is a particular problem for phone numbers or zip codes. While it is difficult to control exactly how these numbers are read aloud, content creators can help by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Displaying the content of the number and using HTML semantics to ensure users and assistive technologies are aware of the number’s purpose. In addition, the following recommendations can assist with improving text-to-speech rendering: </li>
            <li>
              For phone numbers, use the correct layout for the locality of the phone number and ensure users can select the whole phone number (including area code), so that text-to-speech voices can recognize the format and phrase it correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Zip / Postal codes, include state or address information close to the number so that speech voices can expand known abbreviations (such as state names) and listeners can perceive the context.
            </li>
            <li>
              When writing long numbers, consider what separators will be familiar to your readers and how it will be read aloud. In general, English speaking countries will use commas between thousands and a period as the decimal separator whereas German and other European countries do the opposite. For example, 1,245 would represent one thousand two hundred and forty-five in English, but one point two four five in German. Text-to-speech output will assume the separators are being used in the format of the language of its voice. If this does not match the content, then listeners can become easily confused. While replacing thousand separators with a space has become a common convention to avoid confusion, it leads to difficulties with text-to-speech with long numbers being read out in a disjointed fashion. For example, 120 034 943 can be read as one hundred and twenty, zero three four, nine hundred and forty-three.

 		<p>Some languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, have optional vowels and diacritic marks. Without these marks, most words with the same characters have between two (Hebrew) and seven (Arabic) different ways of being pronounced with different meanings. Most readers can read the word based on the context, and use their visual memory to guess the correct pronunciation. People with impaired visual memory, slow readers, and text-to-speech may often guess the incorrect term or pronunciation.</p>

		<p>For example, a user with a language disability is trying to sound out a word. They guess three different pronunciations until they find one that makes sense. Unfortunately, many people with language impairments cannot work out the meaning as words out of context may only provide an idea rather than a specific meaning. Text-to-speech often requires these characters to speak the correct word.</p>

		<p>Note that not all diacritic marks are necessary to pronounce the word correctly. Only letters and diacritic marks that are necessary for the unambiguous pronunciation need to be included.</p>

          <p>
            Step-by-step instructions benefit many people such as people with language impairments, processing difficulties, or a memory impairment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with an impaired working memory cannot hold onto many pieces of information at the same time. They are more likely to make mistakes if they need to remember what they are doing, divide the steps, and track what they have done. When instructions are clearly separated and laid out, they can follow them without making mistakes.

        <p>
          Put white space around objects and text, including boxes, paragraph
          headings, and content, so that each section is clearly separated.
        </p>

          </section><section id="how-it-helps-21"><h5 class="coga-5" id="x4-4-10-3-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">4.4.10.3 </bdi>How it Helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-21"></a></h5>
          <p>
            White space (also called negative space or the background color)
            reduces clutter and provides definition to content. This gives the
            viewer a clear overview of a web page. It is used by designers to
            enhance text and the position of objects on a page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using white space aids navigation through a page and helps people read it. It can help the user find important elements on a page. For those with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-30" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>, white space has been shown to ease reading difficulties and improve understanding of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure users can also adjust the amount of white space around
            objects and text via a web extension or user setting. This supports
            the ability to identify important elements in the content of a web
            page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Use clear spacing between letters, words, sentences lines,
            paragraphs, and blocks of text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allow for the ability to easily adjust white space around objects and text, including boxes, paragraph headings, and content, to a degree that suits the user and does not disrupt the overall integrity of a web page. Do not add so much white space that important content cannot be seen above the scroll.
          </p>
          <p> Note that “white space” is a term that means the background color. It does not always need to be always white! </p>

          <p> Reading a sentence phrase by phrase conveys more meaning than reading individual words. Phrases are also easier to comprehend. The more words an individual can process in one glance, the faster they can read, the easier they can understand what’s written, and the more they stay interested. Most people can take in a whole line of text, or more at once. Fixating on many words at a time is necessary for comprehension for many people. A slow reader may read a sentence slowly using 6 to 9 eye fixations, sometimes taking in only a single word (or part of a word) at a time. Adding backgrounds reduces the number of words readers can fixate on. Removing backgrounds helps users comprehend more words at the same time. </p>

		  <p>Also, automatic word recognition is often used for reading comprehension. For example, approximately 200 words exist in the English language that do not fit traditional letter sound patterns. These words must be memorized and automatically recognized. If a user can’t recognize these words, the text is harder to understand. Backgrounds can increase the amount of time it takes users to recognize words. </p>
      <p>Similarly, background noise in an audio track can make it harder to process and understand the main content.</p>

             		<p>Implied content can be difficult for some users because the meaning is not clear. This includes abstract content, sarcasm, or metaphors. The meaning is not clear and requires the user to have additional knowledge to understand.</p>

            <p>When using body gestures, emotional communication, and facial expressions as the only way to communicate something, it is important to include this in another way to ensure all users understand. One way this can be done is through supplementary text.</p>
            <p>For example, an image is used in a social media post to communicate a person’s true feelings. Some individuals may not be able to understand the emotion being demonstrated by the image. They miss the point the author is trying to make without more context.</p>

They were watching the actors’ mouths, but information such as sarcasm is communicated by their facial expressions.

          <p>Not all people can understand numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
          <p>
            For example, some people have dyscalculia, a learning disability
            specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have
            significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but
            often excel in other intellectual areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with dyscalculia may have difficulty processing
            temperature data when presented only in a numeric format. However,
            if non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then
            they are able to understand the content.

            Numeracy issues can occur due to a range of disabilities, the most
            severe being the inability to read or understand numbers. Other
            people have challenges with any calculations such as relative sizes
            or times.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user may understand the concept of 90cms as a length but find it hard to cope with the fact that 0.9m and 900mm are the same length.
          </p>
          <p>In another example, a train schedule has a list of relative times that the train leaves on the hour. The user cannot calculate when the next train leaves from their location.</p>

      <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#objective-4-help-users-avoid-mistakes-and-know-how-to-correct-them-0"></a></h3>
      <p>Users should be able to avoid mistakes and correct them easily if mistakes occur.</p>
      <p>It is difficult for many users to complete forms, especially people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-31" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. A good design makes errors less likely.</p>
      <p>Users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-32" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> are more likely to make mistakes. This can include entering information incorrectly or accidently touching the wrong control. Help the user notice form errors and make it easy to correct them. Always let users go back and recover if they accidentally touch a control.</p>
      <p>Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-33" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. Many users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-34" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> cannot remember numbers, such as zip or post codes or their social security number. Many users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks. Help them by providing a design that reduces mistakes. Give them the time they need without annoying timeouts and data loss.</p>

          <p>Make sure controls and content remain in place and do not move, unless the user initiates the movement. </p>
          <p>A user may initiate a movement by triggering an action or by altering a property of the device, such as window size.</p>
          <p>This can usually be achieved by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ensuring controls and content do not move about as the page loads or refreshes,</li>
                <li>displaying a clear “loading” indicator if content moves or changes during a page load,</li>
                <li>not updating or moving content, such as an item’s position in a list, unless the user causes it.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>If a control moves, users with slow hand-eye coordination or impaired cognitive processing speed may hit the wrong control. This causes unwanted actions and errors. The user may experience disorientation, confusion or even incorrect understanding of the content.</p>
          <p>For example, a user moves to press a button on a video. The user accidentally nudges the device. The orientation changes to landscape and the control moves. Because the user has slow eye tracking or hand-eye coordination, they end up pressing a link to a new video.</p>
          <p>Shifting controls and content can also cause cognitive overload and increase mental fatigue. For example, as a user with Traumatic <a href="#dfn-brain-injury" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-brain-injury-1" title="Brain injury including, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired brain injury (ABI), are caused by damage to the brain which can lead to long-term impairment of executive function, memory, learning, coordination, speech, and emotions as well as other physical and sensory impairments">Brain Injury</a> reads content, the content refreshes and an additional article appears above the current content. The article the user is reading moves down. The user becomes disoriented and the application becomes very hard to use or understand.</p>

        <p>Always let the user return to a previous point.</p>
        <p>
          The standard back button is the best way to do this as it is familiar
          to the user. Many users will try the back button first.
        </p>
        <p>The user should never lose their work if they press back.</p>
          </section><section id="how-it-helps-26"><h5 class="coga-5" id="x4-5-2-3-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">4.5.2.3 </bdi>How it Helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-26"></a></h5>
          <p>
            Allowing users to return to a previous point helps prevent mistakes and makes it easy to
            correct mistakes when they happen.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of mistakes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>touching a control by accident,</li>
            <li>opening a new link by accident, and</li>
            <li>closing a window the user intended to keep open.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If a person easily makes mistakes or makes them often, it is
            important that they can go back and make changes without having
            their work or previous choices deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user is watching a video. They try to increase the
            volume but touch a different link instead. A new video now loads.
            The user can press the back button and return to the video they were
            watching before. They now know they can try and increase the volume
            and if they make a mistake, they can easily go back and try again.
          </p>
          <p> In another example, the back button did not work as expected, but took them somewhere else (such as the home page). When they try to change the volume or add a comment they often lose the video they were watching and cannot find the way to get back to it. The user now feels they cannot use any of the web site’s features in case they lose their main content again. They do not expand the screen, change the volume, or leave comments. </p>
          <p>
            In forms, each time the user has to re-enter data presents a new chance for mistakes to occur. Entering and re-entering data can be stressful and tiring for some people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-35" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. This increases the likelihood of mistakes and may make it impossible to submit correct data and complete the intended task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those with anxiety, memory challenges, and difficulty following
            directions, the ability to go back and review information they have
            entered is very important. For example, for some people the task of
            following directions and reviewing their answers works best as two
            separate tasks. Being able to enter information with their focus
            being on following the directions, and later going back to review
            their answers, helps them be more effective.

              <p>For example, a person who has challenges with <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-15" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a> may be trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra fees not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international fees, baggage fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only to find that they cannot afford it. Alternatively, sometimes they end up purchasing something they cannot afford. Also, even if they have completed this process in the past, they may not be not able to use their experience to anticipate the final price. The result is the user loses confidence in their ability to independently purchase a holiday online. They may have a debt they are unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help of a hired professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).</p>

            <p>After making many errors, people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-38" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> and users with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-6" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a> often abandon their tasks and believe they cannot complete them. Error messages may be confusing. Correcting errors is often difficult and frustrating for users and increases cognitive fatigue. Many users need to stop when they get successive errors.</p>
            <p>For example, while registering for an online banking account a form requires the input of the user’s birthdate. The required input format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a single input field with no input correction is presented, a user with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 triggering an error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the required format is 01/03/1996 (even if the format is shown below the input field or in the error notification).</p>
            <p>A well-designed form makes it easier to fill in the information and prevents the user from making mistakes by automatically correcting or suggesting the correct date format.</p>
            <p>Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be tiring and distracting, taking focus away from tasks and task completion.</p>

            People with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-39" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> make many more
            mistakes filling out forms than the general population. When
            mistakes cannot be easily corrected they cannot complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to undo errors helps people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-40" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> safely use forms
            and reduces the consequences that result from a mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that
            they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add
            the item a second time. They may confuse the dates when booking a
            trip or make other mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential that people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-41" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> have the
            opportunity to check their work and fix their mistakes easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            For people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-42" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>, mistakes being theoretically
            reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a
            transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may
            not have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the
            mistakes they have made. In
            addition, if the process of correcting mistakes is too difficult,
            users may stop, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating. As a result,
            many users with disabilities may stop using
            the Internet for many tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart
            at any time can significantly reduce mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs
            before the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify
            any errors and make changes to the order. In this example given, a
            summary of the purchase helps the user see the error in quantity as
            well as a higher than expected order total.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, a user may realize that a mistake has been made after
            the final submission of data. Provide simple language instructions on how to
            cancel transactions and help the user understand the amount of
            time needed to cancel a transaction. This makes them less
            susceptible to scams.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder purchasing a travel ticket on a web site may struggle with
            details and may have an impaired attention span. The successful completion
            of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in
            the process. An error
            such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing
            address will result in the order not going though. If a summary is
            not provided before submitting the final order, the
            user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and give
            up on the order. The user may also stop if there is not a clear and achievable
            way to make a correction.

        			<p>When labels are missing or unclear, users often do not know that the feature is available or what the control is. Although many users can guess what a control is for users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-44" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> with impaired memory or <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-16" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a> are less likely to be able to remember the design pattern or work out what it is. A clear label that uses familiar terms and is located next to the control, helps people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-45" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.</p>
              <p>Similarly, if a label is not next to a control it is confusing for some users. When a label cannot be next to a control, there should be clear visual indicators that visibly and unambiguously associate the label with the control. This will need user testing with users who have learning and <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-46" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> to ensure it is usable.</p>

Some controls do not have visual labels. A caregiver shows them what the control is for and they can use the application. The next day they try to use it again, but cannot remember what the control is for. This application is not usable for them.</p>
              <p>In another example, the label disappears when the focus is removed. The user cannot remember what the control is and does not know how to make it reappear.</p>
              <p>Labels need to be visible, readable by assistive technology, and be nearby the labeled content.</p>

          <p> Clear instructions help prevent user errors. This reduces frustration and enhances users’ autonomy and independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps many people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-49" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> as well as people from different cultures, emerging markets, and new users who may not be familiar with web forms or may miss cultural context. </p>

            Users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-51" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may need additional time to look up the information required to complete a transaction. They may need a break, without losing their place in the process, and without losing data that has already been entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, while making a purchase on an e-commerce web site, a user does not remember required information. This may be a date, a phone number, or a zip code that may seem easy to remember for users without a cognitive or learning disability. They need to look up this information, which takes them time away from the screen. Then they need to copy it carefully into the form.
          </p>

          <p>
            In another example, a user is completing an online process for reserving a hotel room and purchasing a plane ticket. They become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and data input required to complete the process. The user cannot complete the process in one sitting, and takes a break.
          </p>

          <p> Users’ cognitive skills may diminish as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day. When users know that their data won’t be lost, they can recover from mental fatigue and return to successfully complete the task. </p>
		      <p>It is important to note that many people need time to read the “timeout” notice. Often, the session ends before the user has finished reading about how to extend the time. If the user is looking up information, they will not see the timeout notice. </p>

          <p>
            When a web site must timeout because sensitive information (such as credit card information) is entered or displayed, the web site should ask for the sensitive information at the last stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web site should also warn the user that once they give the credit card information they should complete the process quickly as the session can timeout.

                 <li>

          Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a
          variety of <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-52" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. This includes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did
              something),
            </li>
            <li>prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome, and</li>
            <li>remember what they just did.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-10" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a>, may have difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press the send button they may not feel confident that the form was submitted. Feedback, such as a thank you message, will tell them submission occurred and make them feel confident in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback) can also assist people with attention or short-term <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-53" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> to remember what they are doing. For example, a user with early dementia may get distracted and then forget exactly where they were in the task. This user-action feedback helps re-orient them. It also helps them avoid leaving a task by reminding them that they are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every
            user action. When possible, the feedback should use consistent and
            familiar design patterns. For example:

            <p>Users need to know they are safe and secure when using a web site, especially when providing information or communicating with others.</p>

            <p>Users with impaired <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-17" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a> are less likely to identify risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the user stay <strong>safe and in control</strong>. Add helpful tips for staying safe while using your content and provide help in case of problems.</p>
            <p>To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups with people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-54" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> and to work with people with cognitive and learning disabilities to solve potential and existing problems. Groups should have people with learning and cognitive disabilities in mind when working on security and risk mitigation.</p>
            <p>For example, many people who cannot copy and paste passwords or use two-step authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As caregivers are often just temporary employees, this leaves the user exposed. Making passwords longer or requiring users change them regularly increases these unsafe practices and can actually make the application less secure. This type of design error is common when people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-55" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> are left out of the user research and analysis.</p>

 		         <p>Most people are familiar with a single set of units that are commonly used for metrics in their location or culture. When the metrics are in other units they need to perform a conversion in order to understand them. Even tools such as a calculator can be hard to manage. Provide an option to change units and default the units to the users’ location. Common examples are the units used for distance, weight, area, currency, and temperature.</p>
		<p>For example, a user may know the temperature in Centigrade. When it is given in Fahrenheit, they think it is going to become very warm.</p>

          <p>Sometimes metrics are commonly declared in a specific unit even when localized alternatives are available. For example, TV or monitor sizes are usually given in inches even when centimeters are the common unit. However, even, in these cases, providing alternatives are still useful as users may not be familiar with the metrics given.</p>

          <p>Once users become distracted, they may find it difficult to remember what they were doing. Then they can no longer complete their task. This is especially problematic for users with both impaired attention and impaired memory, such as users with dementia.</p>
          <p>Avoid using any content or elements that distract users or interrupt them. Also, consider removing content the user will find unnecessary. Provide clear headings and breadcrumbs to help users reorient and refocus if they lose focus.</p>
          <p>Also, help users maintain focus on their task by telling them what information they may need to prepare at the beginning of the task, so that they can collect all required information before starting.</p>

            Interruptions stop people with memory or attention impairments from completing their task. This can include individuals with Dementia, those that have had a stroke or <a href="#dfn-brain-injury" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-brain-injury-2" title="Brain injury including, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired brain injury (ABI), are caused by damage to the brain which can lead to long-term impairment of executive function, memory, learning, coordination, speech, and emotions as well as other physical and sensory impairments">brain injury</a>, and those taking medications with side effects impacting memory or attention. Certain types of interruptions or a certain number may cause them to stop, even if the task is very important. Interruptions can include sounds, content that visually appears or changes (such as advertisements on a page). Interruptions can be as simple as text notifications about the presence of new changes while working in a shared online document.
          </p>
            <p>A site will work best for those with memory or attention challenges
            if they have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a quiet and simple environment,</li>
            <li>no interruptions at all,</li>
            <li>an easy to use pause option so interruptions and moving content can be viewed later, or</li>
            <li>a setting where users can select which types of interruptions they can manage and when.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Many news web sites have a lot of interruptions that can cause
            challenges for people needing to read important information, such as
            school closures due to bad weather. They may encounter breaking news
            text, advertisements, and pop-up windows. For those with difficulty
            focusing and sifting through the school names, or have two or three
            they need to check, these distractions may make the task impossible.
            By letting the user pause these distractions, and ideally
            temporarily remove them from the page, they will better be able to
            complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>Some people are sensitive to noise and can easily become overwhelmed by too many stimuli. </p>
		  <p>
			  Sometimes, noises and different types of content may adversely affect <a href="#dfn-mental-health" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-mental-health-4" title="May include: mental heath impairments">mental health</a>. For example, noises, distractions, or distressing content may make the user more anxious or possibly trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There has also been research to suggest that too many interruptions and use of social media may aggravate depression and difficulty focusing. Allowing users to control this content could help them be more productive online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where standard techniques exist to remove or control distractions, they should be used.
          </p>
		  <p>For example, a person with traumatic <a href="#dfn-brain-injury" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-brain-injury-3" title="Brain injury including, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired brain injury (ABI), are caused by damage to the brain which can lead to long-term impairment of executive function, memory, learning, coordination, speech, and emotions as well as other physical and sensory impairments">brain injury</a> is filling out their taxes online.
		  The social media application pings them with notifications. They try to turn notifications
		  off and then they try to turn off the application, but it is too complex. They are unable
		  to submit their taxes without help. </p>

              <ol>
              <li>Processes that only require necessary steps.
              <ul>
              <li>For example: The steps included in the online process to buy movie tickets are:
              <ul>
              <li>select a movie,</li>
              <li>select the date and time,</li>
              <li>select seats,</li>
              <li>pay,</li>
              <li>print or save tickets.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The movie theater allows the user to view descriptions about the movie and ratings, buy snacks ahead of time, and donate to a charity. These actions, or steps, are not required in order for the user to complete the task of purchasing a movie ticket. Instead of requiring the user make these selections as part of the purchasing process, the user is given these options before the process is started and after it is complete.</p>

              </li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>Short navigation to key features. For example, for the most used function in an app:

              <li>open the app,</li>
              <li>run the most used function.</li>
              </ul>

              <li>Adding unnecessary steps. For example, the steps included in the online process to buy movie tickets are:
              <ul>
              <li>select a movie,</li>

              <li>select seats,</li>
              <li>purchase snacks ahead of time or opt out,</li>
              <li>make a charitable donation or opt out,</li>

              </li>
              </ol>
              <p>The movie theater forces users to decide on snacks and make a charitable donation before paying for their tickets. While an opt out option is available, it is somewhat hidden on the screen, particularly on mobile devices, and users often stop when they cannot figure out how to pay.</p>

        <p>
          Keep the interface simple. Provide users with five or less main choices on each screen and remove unnecessary content. This can be provided via a simplified version, as an alternative that is generated in real time from the same code base as the main content.
        </p>
        <p> Extra links that do not relate to the main purpose of the page should be limited to the footer section. Extra choices can also be hidden under a “more” link or other clear and descriptive titles. </p>

          <p>
            Busy pages, too much text, too many images and too much other content can cause cognitive overload, anxiety and loss of focus. Keeping content down to a small number of important points reduces the clutter, calms the user, and allows for better understanding while aiding memory. For example, it can help  slow readers or  those with a short attention span, who may leave the page if it appears complex.
          </p>
		      <p>Simplified content and a consistent simple design helps reduce cognitive overload and decreases stress and mental fatigue. For example, a person with <a href="#dfn-early-stage-dementia" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-early-stage-dementia-5">early stage dementia</a> goes to their doctor’s application. There are five choices on the screen: appointments, ask your doctor a question, test results, approvals and more. Each option has an icon, clear text, and is separated by whitespace. In two clicks they have asked their doctor their question. They can easily select what they need without asking for help. More options are also available if they swipe left. However, they are unlikely to do so.</p>

          </section><section id="more-details-29"><h5 class="coga-5" id="x4-6-3-4-more-details"><bdi class="secno">4.6.3.4 </bdi>More Details<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#more-details-29"></a></h5>
          <p>
            Avoiding long paragraphs, lots of choices, and non-meaningful imagery ensures those with cognitive and learning disabilities can concentrate on the important points being made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping to a few short bullet points and limiting to one or two
            images related to the main subject areas of a web site or service
            allows the user to choose whether to explore the site further.
          </p>

          <p>
            The intent of this pattern is not to clutter the page with
            unnecessary information but to provide important cues and
            instructions that will benefit people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Too much
            information or instruction can be just as much of a hindrance as too
            little. The goal is to make certain that enough information is
            provided for the user to accomplish the task without undue confusion
            or navigation.

        <p>Emphasize the start of important tasks.</p>
		<p>Before a user performs a task consisting of multiple steps, ensure they have an estimate of the
		amount of effort required to complete the task. This should include:</p>
			<ul><li>the time it might take, </li>
				<li>details of any resources needed to perform the task, and</li>
				<li>overview of the process and next step.</li></ul>
		<p>Once the user starts the task, ensure the user clearly understands when the task is still “in-process” and when it has been completed.</p>

          <p> Some users find distractions difficult especially when the distractions cause them to switch focus mid-task and subsequently return to where they left off. For example, a web site may have a large arrow pointing the way to the “book here” link. The arrow emphasizes the start of the booking task, and will help users know when they have started the task. </p>
          <p>
            Often people need to manage their times of concentration so they can focus without interruptions. Prior advice on the time a task takes, its complexity, or working memory load enables them to better prepare and complete it. The list of required resources before starting the task, along with the number steps left until completion of the task, will help users avoid failures.

        <p>Memory barriers stop many users from using products or accessing help or content.</p>
        <p>People with any impairment that affects memory or language can find it difficult or impossible to overcome memory barriers.</p>
        <p>For example, many users have an impaired short-term memory. On average people can remember 7 letters or items at the same time. A person with an impaired working memory may be able to remember one to four pieces of information at the same time (depending on the extent of the impairment). If they need to remember other tasks, such as track what they have done, they are likely to make mistakes.</p>

        <p>Avoid barriers such as:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>navigating voice menus that involve remembering a specific number or term,</li>
          <li>remembering numbers while processing words on a voice menu,</li>
          <li>transcribing text, or</li>
          <li>remembering passwords.</li>
          </ul>
         <p>Allow users access to content, services or help, without using processes that rely on memory. Make sure there is an easier option for people who need it.</p>

          <p>
            People with <a href="#dfn-memory-impairment" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-memory-impairment-3" title="Memory impairment refers to an inability to recognize or recall pieces of information or skills that are usually remembered">memory impairments</a> often forget their passwords and are not able to login. Their solutions often are only sometimes helpful and have security risks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They may have to look at or listen to text several times to copy
              or type it into a form field.
            </li>
            <li>
              They may reuse a single password or use a simple-to-remember
              password, which they can remember.
            </li>
            <li>
              If they need to change their password or use a complicated
              password they may store passwords insecurely, such as written on
              pieces of paper which other people can see.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>They may also struggle with other steps during login, such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>entering characters in the correct order,</li>
            <li>entering characters correctly with a limited number of tries (resulting in being locked out),</li>
            <li>finding a PIN,</li>
            <li>working out puzzles or distorted letters,</li>

            <li>copy characters correctly from another device.</li> </ul>
                      <p>Users can stop after getting frustrated with time-limited procedures or presentations of digital security tokens. Or they can be locked out of vital services because of their disability.</p>
            <p>Without this design requirement, many people cannot use an application or content at all. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/privacy-security.html">Security and Privacy Technologies</a> issue paper for the full description of this issue, and how it stops people from using web services that are often critical. For example, many people cannot make doctors’ appointments, etc., by themselves. This may be partly responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</p>

          <p>There are many ways to meet this design pattern:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">Web Authentication: An
<abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> for accessing Public Key Credentials</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-webauthn-2" title="Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials - Level 2">webauthn-2</a></cite>] to support inclusive alternatives that do not rely on typical cognitive abilities. For example, hardware authentication devices, smartcard or FIDO.</li>
            <li>Provide automatic user authentication based upon the use of a trusted device (to which the user has already logged in with their own identity). The user does not have to transcribe characters, but may have to press a link to identify they have the device.</li>
            <li>Allow a biometrics option.</li>
            <li>Use a system the user is already logged into via third-party authentication services (e.g., OAuth etc.).</li>
            </ul>
			<p>
              Methods of meeting requirements for alternative user
              authentication would include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Clicking a link sent to an email address or a phone number.
                  (Note that this is easy to implement and may be useful for
                  minimal security, such as allowing comments on a blog.)
                </li>
                <li> Logging in by using information present in users’ personal documentation, such as the total number of a current account balance, with explanation on how to find this information. </li>

          <p> Many people cannot use voice menu systems. This often stops people from completing critical tasks by themselves. Often this can include making doctors’ appointments, getting health insurance, reaching social services, getting their water turned back on, etc. </p>
          <p> If people cannot manage voice menus by themselves, they have to ask someone else to help them. This means the service is not accessible to them. Sometimes tasks are not done. For example, they may delay making a doctor’s appointment or other critical task as not to bother their helper. People often do not get the help they need or get it too late. (This may be partly responsible for the lower life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive disabilities.) </p>

          <p>Why can’t people use complex menus?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A good short-term and working memory (several seconds) is essential so that the user can remember the number or the term for the menu. Without these functions the user is likely to select the wrong number.</li>
            <li>Many users have an impaired working memory. For example, if you can remember 7 letters or items in your head at the same time they may be able to remember one or two. This makes them less likely to manage a menu system correctly.</li>
            <li>For example, a phone menu system (voice markup system) may have an option: “Press 3 for internal services”. To use this option the user must remember a digit 3 while figuring out if they need an internal service. Many people cannot do this. It also requires them to press the correct digit.</li>
            <li>When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct option, the user may have cognitive overload and stop. This is especially true if they did not understand all the earlier options and information.</li>
            <li>They may not understand the terms used. Having focused on the menu, they may forget why they are calling.</li>
            <li>Alternative routes, such as web menus, may be provided but are also complex. They are therefore not helpful.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> The 0 digit, the word “help” or other culturally appropriate term, should be reserved for reaching a person. Consistently set the first option for each menu to: “to wait for a person who can help you press 0”. This can help everyone reach the support they need. </p>

		      <p>Test any system with a wide range of users with different learning and cognitive disabilities.

          <p>Follow best practices in general <a href="#dfn-voice-user-interfaces" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-voice-user-interfaces-1" title="Voice user interfaces (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a computer system based on audio input and/or output">voice user interfaces</a> (VUIs) design. Standard best practices in <a href="#dfn-voice-user-interfaces" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-voice-user-interfaces-2" title="Voice user interfaces (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a computer system based on audio input and/or output">voice user interfaces</a> apply to users with cognitive disabilities, and should be followed. These practices are improving as more designs focus on <a href="#dfn-voice-user-interfaces" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-voice-user-interfaces-3" title="Voice user interfaces (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a computer system based on audio input and/or output">conversational interfaces</a>. Some examples of generally accepted best practices in <a href="#dfn-voice-user-interfaces" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-voice-user-interfaces-4" title="Voice user interfaces (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a computer system based on audio input and/or output">voice user interfaces</a> design:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pauses are important between phrases in order to allow processing time of language and options.</li>
            <li>Options in text should be given before the digit to select, or the instruction to select that option. This will mean that the user does not need to remember the digit or instruction whilst processing the term. For example: The prompt “press 1 for the secretary,” requires the user to remember the digit 1 while interpreting the term “secretary”. A better prompt is “for the secretary (pause): press 1” or “ for the secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1”.</li>
            <li>Error recovery should be simple, and take the user to a human operator if the error persists. Error responses should not end the call or send the user to a more complex menu.</li>
            <li>Advertisements and other extraneous information should not be read as it can confuse the user and can make it harder to retain attention.</li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple and jargon-free as possible.</li>
            <li>Use Tapered prompts. Best practices in <a href="#dfn-voice-user-interfaces" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-voice-user-interfaces-5" title="Voice user interfaces (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a computer system based on audio input and/or output">voice user interfaces</a> design include providing several different prompts for each point in the interaction. The different prompts are used based on the user’s behavior. For example, if the user takes a long time to respond to a prompt, a simpler or more explanatory version of the prompt can be used instead of the default. They should be used to increase the level of prompt detail when the user does not respond as expected.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>User settings</strong></p>
            <p>User-specific settings can be used to customize the <a href="#dfn-voice-user-interfaces" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-voice-user-interfaces-6" title="Voice user interfaces (VUIs) allow the user to interact with a computer system based on audio input and/or output">voice user interfaces</a> (such as menus, and options). Keep in mind that if it is difficult to set user preferences, they won’t be used. Setting preferences by natural language is the most natural (”slow down!”), but is not currently very common.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Extra time should be a user setting for both the speed of speech and ability for the user to define if they need a slower speech or more input time etc. Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).</li>
            <li>The user should be able to extend or disable timeouts as a system default on their device.</li>
            <li>Error recovery should be simple, and take you to a human operator. Error responses should not throw the user off the line or send them to a more complex menu. Preferably they should use a reserved digit for support and human help.</li>
            <li>Advertisement and other information should not be read as it can confuse the user and can make it harder to retain attention.</li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple as possible.</li>
            <li>Examples and advice should be given on how to build a prompt that reduces the cognitive load
            <ul>
            <li>Example 1: Reducing cognitive load: The prompt “press 1 for the secretary,” requires the user to remember the digit 1 while interpreting the term secretary. It is less good then the prompt “for the secretary (pause): press 1” or “ for the secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1”.</li>
            <li>Example 2: Setting a default for a human operator as the number 0.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Considerations for Speech Recognition</strong></p>

            <ul>
            <li>For speech recognition based systems, standards for voice commands for many languages exists and should be used where possible, such as the ETSI standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/202000_202099/202076/02.01.01_50/es_202076v020101m.pdf">ETSI 202 076</a>. Keep in mind that expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a cognitive burden on the user.</li>
            <li>Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their requests in their own words. This can be useful for users who have difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided. Such fallbacks should be easy to use and conform to this document.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Follow requirements of legislation.</p>
            <p>For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255 Accessibility Guidelines [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-section255" title="Telecommunications Access for People with Disabilities">Section255</a></cite>] paragraph 1193.41 Input, control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h), and (i) apply to cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.</p>

            <p>Often content has barriers which prevent users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-61" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> from completing a step or process, and as a result, prevents them from achieving whatever they wished to achieve.</p>
            <p>To increase security when making a purchase, sometimes puzzles or calculations are required. For example: To finalize a purchase, a user is asked to enter the result of multiplying positions 1 and 2 of a number. This type of statement cannot be understood by some people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-62" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. Both security and cognitive accessibility should be guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Many users have an impaired working memory. They cannot remember many details at the same time. However, systems, such as dialog menus, rely on all users using working memory to make choices. They expect the user to remember several choices and to select one choice, whether by speaking or through a key press. The user needs to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind.</p>
            <p>Users with an impaired <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-20" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a> may need more time to complete a task. But there can also be problems if the system response is too slow. For example, some people may need longer to compare similar options such as “billing”, “accounts”, and “sales” and decide which is the service they need. Using clear language will also help.</p>

          <p>Good practice that reduces the reliance on memory skills include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Each step in a process should contain the information necessary to allow a user to proceed. They must <strong>not </strong>rely on memory from prior steps.</li>
            <li>Providing a simple way to go back without having to start at the beginning.</li>
            <li>Inform users of where they are in the process, for example, through a step indicator.</li>
            <li>If users make a mistake or error, provide help to fix it rather than restarting the process.</li>
            <li>When useful, provide a summary of information from previous steps, and an easy mechanism for traversing the process is available.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For voice interfaces:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Pause between each option.</li>
            <li>Waiting for a slow speaker to respond.</li>
            <li>Listen for a quiet or hesitant speaker.</li>
            <li>Allow simple, one word responses</li>
            <li>State the option before the number to command to be selected.</li>

        <p>Many people rely on human help. When possible, there is human help available, and it is easy to use. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Easy to find on each page and at each step of a process.</li>
            <li>Easy to use via the mechanism the user prefers.</li>
            <li>Requires as few steps as possible, such as:
            <ul>
            <li>a form with two fields,</li>
            <li>an email address, or</li>
            <li>a phone number that goes directly to a human.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Access to human help should never require the user to manage complex menu systems such as a voice menu with many different options.</p>

            <p>Organizations mechanisms should be in place to ensure support staff effectively help people with learning and cognitive disabilities and provide a good experience.</p>

            <p>When a user gets stuck or confused for any reason, getting help from a human is usually the most effective solution. In reality many sites provide this option only to users who can navigate complex systems.</p>
            <p>Examples of complex system include a process where a user needs to follow many links to get to the human contact information. It could also be a phone number requiring the user to answer many questions before connecting with a person. With a complex system, the people who need it most will not have access to the human help option. They may the user may have cognitive overload and stop trying to complete the process. They may also leave with a negative attitude towards the service or supplier.</p>
            <p>For example, a user with an intellectual disability wants to use a coupon. They cannot find the instructions for applying the coupon to their online purchase, and they cannot find the phone number for support. They effectively cannot use the coupon.</p>

             <p>The use of complex information, long documents, and complex data formats can present significant barriers to users with cognitive accessibility needs. Users should be able to understand the information and successfully complete described tasks without requiring further external assistance as much as possible.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Semantic headings are used to break the information down into

          When presenting users with actions and selections, clearly explain the benefits, risks and consequences of each option. This includes any:</p>
			<ul><li>changes from what the user asked for,</li>
			<li>disadvantages from the standard product or offering,</li>
			<li>features that may be a  risk to users wellbeing or finances.</li></ul>

          <p>
            Clearly stating benefits and consequences of each action and selection option helps individuals avoid mistakes.
			This is particularly important when the results cannot be easily corrected, lead to safety risks, or may never be known.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, a user of a travel site is booking a trip to Geneva. They see an option at a good time, but this ticket is to a different city. They assume the options given are to the location they asked for. They check the dates and times, but, because they can only read by spelling out words, they do not notice the changed destination. They are taken to a different location than their hotel, and the vulnerable user arrives at night in an unfamiliar city without accommodation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user sees a laptop for sale at a good price. They do not see the refurbished word in the long description. The laptop is not actually a good price.

        <p>
          Provide help for any complex forms, particularly when there are
          multiple steps, unusual interactions, non-standard controls, and
          required fields that do not support autocomplete. Give examples
		  that make it easy to understand what to do.
        </p>

          </section><section id="how-it-helps-49"><h5 class="coga-5" id="x4-8-4-3-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">4.8.4.3 </bdi>How it Helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-49"></a></h5>
          <p>
            Users often find forms and related tasks to be the most complex experience with web sites. They can easily become confused, unsure, or even completely lost. Providing extra help can make the difference between being able to successfully complete a task and giving up. This is especially true if any part of the form is complex or requires nonstandard interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many standard form controls provide support automatically. For example, many fields can be automatically filled in with information using autocomplete or personalization semantics [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-personalization-semantics-content-1.0" title="Personalization Semantics Content Module 1.0">personalization-semantics-content-1.0</a></cite>]. Then the user will not make mistakes filling it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you require additional fields and nonstandard controls many users will have difficulty using them. Many users with disabilities will get the information incorrect or be unable to work out how to complete the task. Often this results in the task being completely abandoned. In other cases, the user asks a caregiver for help to complete the form or work the control. In either case, they have not been able to complete the task because of their disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-html" title="HTML Standard">HTML</a></cite>] forms and controls have been carefully specified for maximum usability and accessibility. They are usually understood by users, especially if they are familiar with web interactions. However, users are likely to experience difficulties if the standard form behavior has been altered or completely new controls are provided. Assuming the new behaviors have been carefully designed and user tested, users may still require help in order to successfully use them.

          <p>Examples of forms and controls that are likely to require additional help:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Password fields that require certain character types of characters to be entered.</li>
            <li>Surveys with complex interactions, for example, where buttons only appear depending on previous answers.</li>
            <li>Date entry where there could be some ambiguity about the required format.</li>

          Make it easy for the user to ask for help or report issues at any point in a process. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easy to Use: Feedback information and forms are simple and clear.
            (User testing with different user groups is highly recommended.)

            Easy to Find: Available from any place where the user may get stuck.
          </li>
		  <li>Using a preferred communication method such as a form, email, chat, or phone support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The option to provide feedback should never require the user to manage

          <p>
            Providing an easy way for users to give feedback will help people be able to share problems, ask for help, make suggestions, and give positive comments. If users cannot give feedback easily, problems will continue to exist without the site owner being aware of the problems. It is essential to allow users to provide feedback from any point in the process so that people do not get lost when trying to explain why they are stuck. Ideas for improvements and positive feedback will also be missed.
          </p>
		  <p>For example, a user with a cognitive and learning disability struggles to use an ecommerce site. They have an idea about how to make it much easier to use. They spend an hour trying to give the feedback and then they stop trying. The site continues to lose customers.</p>

          </section><section id="more-details-35"><h5 class="coga-5" id="x4-8-5-4-more-details"><bdi class="secno">4.8.5.4 </bdi>More Details<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#more-details-35"></a></h5>
          <p>Make sure the feedback option is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>simple to use,</li>
            <li>available in all stages of the process,</li>
            <li>
             a process that responds helpfully to any feedback submitted,
            </li>
            <li>easy to complete and does not make the user provide unnecessary information, and</li>
            <li>not reliant on complex menu systems.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended.
            For example, on a web site, consider providing all 4 options for
            feedback including live chat, a phone number, a web form, and a
            feedback email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that chat bots may not be appropriate for this particular type
            of feedback other than to start the feedback process. These can be
            extremely frustrating if you cannot easily get to the area you are
            trying to reach.

          <p>
           People with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-64" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> experience different levels of difficulty with wayfinding directions or wayfinding applications. The help needed to address wayfinding issues can be different for indoor navigation, where there are more stimuli, and outdoors, where there can be more demands on memory. The help needed also varies with the individual.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wayfinding requires many cognitive functions. Designs should accommodate a wide range of cognitive and learning disabilities including those supported by other design patterns. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>memory,</li>
            <li><a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-21" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a>,</li>
            <li>spatial orientation,</li>
            <li>visual/spatial attention, perception, and processing,</li>
            <li>spatial disorientation anxiety,</li>
            <li>language processing,</li>
            <li>intellectual,</li>
            <li>attention.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Some users may need more detailed help, such as step-by-step directions. Many users need to preview a route before following it. Then landmarks can help with recognition and orientation as well as reducing anxiety. Alternative relative directional terms and cardinal directions matching a user’s preferences are most effective. For example, the application could refer to “the driver’s side” or “the East Wing”. Helping people imagine relative and absolute distances can help, for example, “you’ve travelled half way”. </p>
          <p>
            Due to the wide variation in personal requirements, personalization mechanisms can be very useful. For example, the units used for distances.
            Platforms or other technologies often provide personalization options for relative and cardinal directions and terms which can be used. For
            example, the platform locale settings.
          </p>
          <p>Changes can be very confusing. A user may be prepared to change the route to save hours of traffic, but this will involve them pulling into a gas station to  learn the new route.

They review the route before leaving, and look at pictures of the turns. These preparations will enable them to follow the route. While driving, the route changes to avoid three minutes of traffic. They are no longer able to follow it and become lost.</p>

          <p>
            People with cognitive and learning disabilities often have challenges managing events and time. (In fact, being unable to correctly manage events and time without support is a diagnostic criterion for some groups of disabilities.)  This results in missing meetings, not submitting a request by a certain date or a form within a specified time period and missed opportunities. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the user copies information into a calendar they often copy
              the day or time incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user is challenged processing and retaining time based
              information.
            </li>
            <li>The user may find it hard to sequence time-bound events.</li>
            <li> The user’s skills decrease when tired to such an extent that they have to stop a task. They may wish to reschedule the task. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Using calendar
<abbr title="application programming interface">APIs</abbr> (or task manager) that allow the user to
            automatically add events and deadlines to their own calendar can
            help.</p>
          <p> For example, a user with a cognitive and learning disability sets a doctor’s appointment online. Often they copy the details incorrectly into their calendar. However, in this case, the web site gives them an option to add the appointment to the calendar and sets a reminder an hour before. The user now comes to the correct place at the correct time with the correct papers. </p>
          <p>
            The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that they
            can independently manage appointments, deadlines, and schedules. The
            ability to set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated
            when processing time bound tasks. Time dependent activities may be
            monitored and tracked by the user to ensure that they are completed
            in a timely manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so
            that the user does not get interrupted.
          </p>
          <p> It is essential not to add unwanted reminders, as this makes the user’s calendar too full. This can even prevent them from being able to use their calendar at all. The user is the best person to know how many reminders, and which type, will best meet their needs. </p>

            Date and time sensitive events are any event that has to be
            completed by a certain time. The time constraints on such an event
            may be defined by a calendar date and time or by the total elapsed
            time.
          </p>
          <p> Variables that could be considered include: </p>

          Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route, and

          <p>
            Any content, settings, or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without user initiation can result in significant problems for users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-65" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. Unexpected changes in any of these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons, and design components). Examples include, but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups.</li>
            <li>
              Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly labeled (using simple language to submit the form).
            </li>
            <li>The opening of new content or a feature.</li>
			<li>Unexpected changes when selecting an option.</li>
			<li>Rerouting automatically by a Global Positioning System (<abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>).</li>
            <li>Changing the direction of a map in a <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their
            left and right. Before using a <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>, they may study the route so that
            they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the
            directions of the <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> with their own context, using the <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> for
            cues. The <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> automatically reroutes them because of a small traffic
            delay. They become completely lost and disoriented and can no
            longer use the application.
          </p>
		  <p>In another example, a user is watching a video and wants to press “like”. As they are about to press the button, the controls shift and they load a different video instead of pressing “like”. They are now less likely to press “like” because they do not want to lose their content. As a result, their preferences are not taken into account.</p>
          <p>
            Letting users control when content changes gives users with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-66" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> more control over how web sites and applications behave.

              <p>
                A user who has difficulty reading or using web content can be easily overwhelmed with too much information on a web page. They need to simplify the page to include the critical information that they need and not spend all their energy reading and understanding other content and features. This is also true for users who are easily distracted.
              </p>
              <p> For example, an email program has lots of features and formatting options when drafting an email. This makes it too complex for a lot of people. With personalization the user can have a simple option with only send and cancel options. There is a “to” and subject line but no cc or bcc options. In this setting there is a clear heading (write an email) and they have icons that the user understands. </p>

                  <ol>
                  <li>Allowing user preferences on presentation such as font style, font size, line heights, margins, and contrast. (Note: The default version should still be readable and use clear fonts.)</li>
                  <li>Allowing a rollback to a previous interface that the user is familiar with and knows how to use.</li>
                  <li>Adding semantics on controls, links, and symbols that allow the user to control the experience. For example:
                  <ul>
                  <li>HTML5 autocomplete on common fields,</li>
                  <li>adding a toolbar that adds personalized images,</li>

                    </li>
                  </ol>
            <p>Ensure the user knows the personalization options and can easily configure them. Clear instructions can help. </p>

            <p>Personalization changes the interface to meet the needs of the user.</p>

            <p>Having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be unfamiliar to another requiring them to learn new symbols. Adding semantics allows symbols and support to be added by an extension or browser that is familiar to the individual user.</p>
            <p>A stronger example is people using <abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System"><a href="#dfn-alternative-and-augmentative-communication-system" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-alternative-and-augmentative-communication-system-2" title="Any method, device, or application that can be used to help those who cannot use spoken language and need additional support by means of symbols, images, and/or text"><abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System">AAC</abbr></a></abbr>. These users usually only learn one symbol set. They cannot easily communicate with other people using <abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System"><a href="#dfn-alternative-and-augmentative-communication-system" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-alternative-and-augmentative-communication-system-3" title="Any method, device, or application that can be used to help those who cannot use spoken language and need additional support by means of symbols, images, and/or text"><abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System">AAC</abbr></a></abbr> in a written format or may struggle to understand different symbols used in different applications. When using personalization, such as [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-personalization-semantics-1.0" title="Personalization Semantics 1.0">personalization-semantics-1.0</a></cite>] the user agents can load the symbols that are understandable by the individual user. The user can also access the Web and other applications.</p>


            <p>Other support includes autocomplete and extensions that help the user fill out forms and understand the content. Many users with memory or <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-22" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive function</a> impairments cannot fill in forms without asking someone to help copy over information or check their work. Autocomplete allows many more users to manage forms by themselves.</p>

		<p>Usability testing is the best way to know if your content and design works for real people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-71" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. </p>
		<p>Usability is important for everyone. However, if someone cannot use the content or design without help because of their disability, then the content is not accessible for them. It is important to change the design so that users with cognitive and learning disabilities can use the content independently.</p>
		<p>Including digital accessibility throughout a project, right from the beginning, improves accessibility for all users. Include people with cognitive and learning disabilities in focus groups, user needs, design patterns (repeated designs for controls and other elements) and usability testing.</p>
		<p>Automated testing for accessibility focuses on more technical areas of accessibility. While important, automated testing often cannot  assess if people with a cognitive or learning disability can use the content. It is vital for people with cognitive and learning disabilities that development teams do not rely solely on automated accessibility testing. Development teams should</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Perform usability tests with people who have cognitive and learning disabilities. Usability testing of wireframes, conceptual drawings of the interface, or template pages can be helpful to identify challenges early in the project. You probably know people with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-11" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age related forgetfulness</a>, or a cognitive and learning disability.  Asking them to help find out if your design is usable is a good first step.</li>
			<li>Include people with cognitive and learning disabilities in their teams and the design and development process. This also includes research that has something to do with them. They are the experts in what works for them.</li>

		</ul>
		<p>Sometimes designs and content are usable for some people, but not if they have cognitive or learning impairments. Sometimes content is usable by people with one cognitive and learning disability but not a different one. For example, content with fewer words and more numbers may be perfect for some <a href="#dfn-autistic" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-autistic-3" title="Sometimes called “autism spectrum disorder”, “ASD”, “autism”, “asperger syndrome”, and “pervasive developmental disorder”">autistic</a> and dyslexic users. However, the same content is inaccessible for people with dyscalculia who struggle with numeric information. It is important that usability testing includes a diverse set of users with different cognitive and learning disabilities, such as: people with a memory impairment, learning difficulty, attention impairment, numeric impairment, language and communication disability, and intellectual disability.</p>

<h3 id="x5-2-finding-people-to-include"><bdi class="secno">5.2 </bdi>Finding People to Include<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#finding-people-to-include"></a></h3>

<p>Finding people to include in usability testing who have different  <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-72" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> is strongly encouraged and can be achievable, even for small groups on a low budget. If your organization already involves users, this section aims to expand that activity to include people with cognitive and learning disabilities. For developers without formal user involvement, even a small amount of user input and testing can make a large difference to usability and accessibility. Further links about user testing and usability can be on our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Developer_resources">developer resource page</a>.</p>

<p>People sometimes recruit users from an organization or self-help group for people with learning difficulties. Social media groups can be a convenient resource. Small development groups can achieve a large improvement by asking people who they know, such as friends, colleagues, relatives or neighbors. Try to build a group of users who:</p>

<ul>
<li>are older and struggle to use computers, or have <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-12" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a>,</li>
<li>may be at an early stage of dementia,</li>
<li>have a specific learning disability such as those with dyslexia, dyscalculia, or <a href="#dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d-4" title="Attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or AD(H)D involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted">AD(H)D</a>,</li>
<li>have an intellectual disability, or</li>
<li>have acquired cognitive issues (for example, due to neurological trauma). </li>
</ul>
<p>People with acquired cognitive issues have the same challenges as people with other disabilities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>having difficulty (asking a family member to help) with booking travel booking or hotel booking online,</li>
<li>being unable to use online banking,</li>
<li>coping with content forms and pop-up windows when errors occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is helpful to find people with learning and cognitive difficulties who are also in your target group as customers or users.</p>
<p>If your organization has a more formal process, work with those that help employees or community members get assistive technology or other accommodations. They can put out a call for volunteers to their contacts. This helps individuals self-identify and opt-in to help.</p>

<p>Some organizations also use peer-researchers who have cognitive and learning disabilities. Peer-researchers understand the perspective of people with their disabilities. The researchers and developers work together with peer researchers to find solutions. Peer researchers are also involved in testing the solution with other people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-73" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Developer_resources#Easy_Reading_-_see:_easyreading.eu">Our developer resource page</a> references projects and resources with information on finding and working with persons with learning and cognitive difficulties as co-researchers or peer researchers.</p>

<section id="informed-consent">
<h3 id="x5-3-informed-consent"><bdi class="secno">5.3 </bdi>Informed Consent<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#informed-consent"></a></h3>
<p>It is important to get a declaration of consent from all participants involved in testing and focus groups before they start. Before they sign up, participants must know and understand the details such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the project is for.</li>
<li>What they will be doing and why it is helping you.</li>
<li>Any risks that need to be explained and understood.</li>
<li>What personal details are collected and how any personal data may be used. (Note that their comments should be anonymized before being used in any report.)</li>
<li>They do not have to participate. Participation is always voluntary and they can always stop at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your tester has a guardian, you should get informed consent from <strong>both </strong>the tester and their guardian.</p>
<p>Using an understandable consent form is important. Our design patterns on clear content will help you use clear language and layout. Adding icons and symbols can also help.</p>
<p>Make sure users understand the consent form. This can be done by asking them some questions about the consent that tests that they understand the key points. You can also adapt the example consent forms from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Developer_resources">our developer resource page</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, remind them that participation is always voluntary and they can stop at any time. This is particularly important if they have <a href="#dfn-memory-impairment" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-memory-impairment-7" title="Memory impairment refers to an inability to recognize or recall pieces of information or skills that are usually remembered">memory impairments</a> and may have forgotten that it is their choice to participate. Remember to thank them for their ideas and contribution.</p>
<p>Different areas may require consent for more items than others. Check the legal requirements in your jurisdiction and for your type of content.</p>

<h3 id="x5-4-usability-testing"><bdi class="secno">5.4 </bdi>Usability Testing<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#usability-testing"></a></h3>
<p>One approach to usability is to measure user efficacy, efficiency, and satisfaction for key tasks. This can be done by measuring or tracking:</p>
<ul>
<li>successes in completing tasks while noting any errors to measure efficacy,</li>
<li>time taken per task to measure efficiency. Note that the relative time between tasks is often more useful than absolute numbers, and</li>
<li>user’s mood and comments to measure satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the evaluation you should be able to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What prevents the user from completing a task?</li>
<li>What creates confusion? When and why do they misinterpret the interface?</li>
<li>What produces an error and an incorrect action?</li>
<li>When does the user get frustrated or upset?</li>
<li>When does the user misunderstand navigation, menus, and controls?</li>
<li>How can these problems be avoided?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some differences when usability testing with people who have cognitive and learning disabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask ahead of time if they need any support for their needs. This could include a quiet room or frequent breaks.</li>
<li>Ask what test methods work best for them, such as individual interviews or groups. Some people will prefer to have an interview in their home.
</li>
<li>Ensure participation forms are easy to understand. Confirm that they understand any key points.</li>
<li>Inform the participant that they can request the information in a different format. If they make a request, ensure they receive it with enough time for them to review and ask questions.</li>
<li>Have a copy of the participation forms at the session, in case questions come up before the session begins.</li>
<li>Send participation forms to the participant in advance. Allow plenty of time for the participant to ask questions and fill in forms.</li>
<li>Allow the participant to bring a caregiver, family member, or friend to attend with them.</li>
<li>If your tester has a guardian, you should get consent from both the participant and their guardian.</li>
<li>If they bring a guardian or caregiver, make sure they are not doing the tasks for them. If they give help, monitor closely what help they give, as this may be due to a design fault.</li>
<li>Explain the testing method before the test.</li>
<li>The questions should be short and easy to understand language.</li>
<li>Provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than just asking for the participant. Try asking them to select a smiley face, such as:<em> Figure 1 A simple mood selector</em>.<br><br>


	<figure id="fig-a-simple-mood-selector">
                  <img src="img/faces-happy-to-sad.png" width="200" alt="a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad.">
                  <figcaption>Figure <bdi class="figno">1</bdi> <span class="fig-title">A simple mood selector</span></figcaption>
                </figure>
				</li>
<li>Some individuals also have challenges identifying moods from faces. Other options to consider are simple mood selectors and text-based rating scales where an individual can point to their selection. For example, I really like this, it is fine, I really don’t like this.</li>
<li>Check they understand the methods used to collect the data.</li>
<li>Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making mistakes. While this is always important during usability testing, this scenario is even more likely for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</li>
<li>Ask them for their ideas, such as, what features they would like to see, what design they prefer and what support they find most helpful. Thank them for their contribution.</li>
<li>Make clear that the tester can end the user testing session at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some suggestions of what to look for when conducting usability testing with people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-74" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Before you start, make sure the research team understands that the testers cannot do anything wrong. Research should never harm the user or make them feel bad.</li>
		<li>Make sure the participants and researchers know they can leave at any time. No one should feel bad if they leave!</li>
		<li>Check that the testers understand the task or question. Encourage your testers to “think out loud”. </li>
		<li>Time the task takes to complete, and note any parts where users slow down or seem to struggle. Can your testers manage each task reasonably easily and quickly?  Also, note any errors that they make, including clicking on the wrong item.</li>
		<li>Find out if completing the task is frustrating or upsetting.
			<ol>
			<li>You can ask users how they are feeling before and after the tasks or rate their mood such as selecting the smiley face which represents how they feel.</li>
			<li>Ask them if anything was annoying.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Ask how you can make it better for your users (people with cognitive and learning disabilities)?</li>
		<li>Ask your users if they have suggestions about what would make the interface easier for them to use. This is often best at the end of the usability test. </li>
		<li>If the user is struggling, remind them that you are reviewing the system not them and that their insights are really helpful. Thank them for helping. Remind them that it is helpful when they find issues because it helps the team make the product better. Stop the process if users are getting distressed.</li>
		<li>Analyze the data collected and review the findings with the team. Remember to keep the names of individuals confidential (unless they have given permission for their identity and disability to be shared).</li>

<section id="test-objectives">
<h3 id="x5-5-test-objectives"><bdi class="secno">5.5 </bdi>Test Objectives<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#test-objectives"></a></h3>
<p>You can test the objectives of the design guide. If they are successful, that section can be considered completed!</p>

<p>For each objective, make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of cognitive and learning disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to complete an action that demonstrates usability. Test for the following but set up the tests so that the user demonstrates their knowledge and understanding rather than answers a simple question:
Are enough user groups represented?</p>
<p>For example, a typical project may wish to include: People living with <a href="#dfn-early-stage-dementia" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-early-stage-dementia-6">early stage dementia</a>, <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-13" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a>, intellectual disabilities, different specific cognitive and learning disabilities and communication disabilities.</p>

          <p>Alison has a medical background, working in rehabilitation of physical injuries. She recently decided to work part-time to take up more hobbies and be with her grandchildren. She wants to try an online course to learn Chinese, in preparation for a special holiday. Alison considers 63 to be the new 36. However, she has difficulty concentrating and finding the word she wants to say. She often makes typos and has to correct sentences when she re-reads them. She becomes easily frustrated as she finds new technical things, like updated design patterns and applications, hard to learn and less intuitive than they used to be. Plus, navigation takes longer than in the past. Unfortunately, this includes learning how to use a new interface and this affects the way she works when swapping between her tablet, phone, and computer.</p>

<section id="alison-scenario-1-learning-how-to-use-new-technologies-and-interfaces">
              <h4 id="x6-1-1-alison-scenario-1-learning-how-to-use-new-technologies-and-interfaces"><bdi class="secno">6.1.1 </bdi>Alison Scenario 1: Learning How to Use New Technologies and Interfaces<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#alison-scenario-1-learning-how-to-use-new-technologies-and-interfaces"></a></h4>
              <p>Alison took an evening course to learn how to use Windows and MS Word ten years ago and used to feel very comfortable with the interface. She has a new computer now and finds that most applications look very different. She realizes that links and buttons have changed appearance and does not know what to press. Sometimes she presses a picture or stylized heading that is not a control and is not sure if the internet is down, the site is broken or she has made a mistake. Sometimes she touches something accidentally and the focus moves to a different page or application. For example, she recently tried to enlarge some small text and activated a link instead of enlarging it! She misses the days when all links were in blue and underlined.</p>

              <p>Alison loses self-confidence when things go wrong. For example, selecting an incorrect button or getting an error that she does not understand. She knows to try and press the back button to go back a step, but it does not always work as she thinks it will. She tends to think she cannot cope, so gives up, but with support to adapt the interface to suit her needs she can learn to use the new style.</p>

              <p>Her children worked with her to reduce the number of menu items on the application toolbar so she can concentrate on the ones she regularly uses. They helped her change her settings so when searching for items on the Web, only a limited number appear at one time. They also found her a de-cluttering browser extension that takes away many of the advertisements and other items that clutter her social media pages when communicating with her grandchildren.</p>

              <p>When writing letters and messages on her computer, phone, and tablet, Alison pauses every so often and checks that what she is writing makes sense. She finds it very annoying having to work so slowly. However, by using text-to-speech to read out content she has found she can hear her mistakes more easily than noticing them on the screen. She has also discovered that this process can make reading web pages easier and less tiring. Nevertheless, she often has to go over instructions several times before completing tasks online. She depends on forms that do not timeout or have an option to allow her to extend the time to fill in the edit boxes.</p>

              <p>Alison knows her math skills are not as sharp as they used to be. She is worried about making mistakes that will put her financially at risk. She is not sure she should be using her credit card online. Alison wants to feel safe and supported.</p>
              <p>She finds that autocomplete helps when filling out forms. However, she tends to worry that what is entered may not be accurate. She has a paper card listing some commonly needed information such as her phone number, address, and postcode. She stores secure information in a special folder. She has also set up an agreement with the bank to limit spending on her credit card and mobile banking.</p>

              <p>Alison would like to give feedback and tell her bank what changes they can make to their web site to make it more usable for her and other mature customers. She struggles to find the feedback form and she has to type in a lot of information to send her suggestions. When she types in her phone number without the area code she receives an error. She tries to fix the error and send the suggestion but the send button becomes disabled, so she probably needs to correct something else as well. At this point Alison feels they do not want her feedback and gives up. She now uses the site much less often. She also finds it hard to reach a support person on the phone because of the confusing phone menu system, so drives into the bank instead. She is thinking of changing to her daughter’s bank, so her daughter can help her.</p>

          <p>Amy loved her computer science course and now programs in several languages. She has discovered she can visualize the outcome of her coding and is quick to find any errors even if they are not highlighted. Writing documentation is less fun and she is too concise. This means some users do not receive enough help using her applications.</p>

            <p>Being able to code your own web sites can make you very critical of others! Amy copes best when important elements are consistently positioned where she can see them. She can then focus on the actual content and not on finding things. She often feels quite confused by some social media sites that have dynamically changing content with random messages and advertisements. She either avoids these sites or tends to try to personalize them by clearing away the clutter and choosing to hide sections. Navigation that does not follow a simple route across an entire site really annoys her, as she feels this does not help anyone. She also finds that she is missing important information on sites that have too much information on pages or have no clear and logical structure.</p>

            <p>A page that loads automatically or animations and videos that play automatically cause problems for Amy. Sometimes, the movement can be very distracting and the sounds alarming. Amy has always found that sudden noises or something happening unintentionally has been a problem. When designing her own applications and web sites, she makes sure the controls for animated objects and videos are clearly visible and do not start until the user decides to play them.</p>

            <p>Amy is always concerned about communicating clearly. She finds it hard when people ask her to create a design that includes abstract imagery. Images that do not directly represent something make Amy feel uneasy. She tends to ask if there can be some explanatory text in case other users are confused. Figures of speech where someone has written something that is not literal make her wish that the writer would use <a href="#dfn-easy-to-understand-language" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-easy-to-understand-language-14" title="Easy to Understand Language refers to text content that is in an accessible, easy to understand, form">easy to understand language</a> as it is hard to understand concepts such as, "the wheels of justice turn slowly".</p>

          <p>George enjoys his job and lives semi-independently in a small town, where he can easily find his way around. However, George finds it hard to use search engines and navigate around web sites because of the need to work with large blocks of text. He has problems using the online systems at work, and needs help to search for suitable videos or music. </p>

            <p>George used symbols in a <a href="#dfn-alternative-and-augmentative-communication-system" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-alternative-and-augmentative-communication-system-4" title="Any method, device, or application that can be used to help those who cannot use spoken language and need additional support by means of symbols, images, and/or text">alternative and augmentative communication system</a> and gestures when at school. He is able to communicate relatively easily now, although reading and writing remains a challenge. Surfing the Web is hard when most interactions require text input. Even with these challenges, George likes to watch videos, find images, and listen to music as well as playing games online. Friends have set up links with recognizable icons on his tablet and this has made it easy to visit his favorite sites. If recognizable symbols or icons are used, George feels he is able to reach more sites independently. There are search engines designed for children and these often use more images. However, these tend to be too childish for George's taste.</p>

            <p>George was told about surfing safely and not giving out personal information. He is very lucky that his family has set up his social media and chat account with various privacy settings. However, George finds the way emojis change or new icons keep appearing on his message systems rather confusing. He does not always realize what some of them mean. He has sometimes selected an inappropriate symbol and then receives a rather short message from a friend in return that is upsetting. He finds it hard to explain what might have happened. He knows there are times when he really cannot choose the right symbol because it is too small and he finds it hard to accurately hit the spot. George is then very worried as he does not know how to 'unlike' or change his symbol choice. Interacting with emojis, icons and symbols is much easier for him with easy ways to enlarge these features on touch interfaces and to undo errors.</p>

            <p>Using a mouse is not easy for everyone and double clicking can take time to learn. George has worked hard to improve his mouse skills by playing many onscreen games. However, he still finds it hard to move accurately enough to skip ads on videos or to track down the close/exit method offered by some pop-up windows. Once again friends have come to the rescue and enabled an ad blocker extension for his browser. However, this does not always capture all the ads or prevent George from selecting the submit button rather than a cross or exit button on a pop-up. There have been times when George has downloaded malware without any second warning appearing. Sometimes he is unable to reach a site because he cannot find the small cross on a transparent popup window that overlays the main page.</p>

            <p>George finds it very hard to read instructions unless they use very short and <a href="#dfn-easy-to-understand-language" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-easy-to-understand-language-16" title="Easy to Understand Language refers to text content that is in an accessible, easy to understand, form">easy to understand language</a>. He needs text that has been simplified. The best option for George is when there is  a summary of a paragraph with a well-known symbol, short bullet points and a clear diagram or image of what is required. He finds videos with instructions usually go too quickly. He has to stop them, going back time and time again. Helpful instructions with well broken up sets of phrases using easy to understand words can work well. He can then go back to them when he has to remember how to do a particular task.</p>

          <p>Gopal retired from his law firm in his early 60s when he found he was forgetting important items that needed to be discussed in his complex caseload. He found that he was forgetting material that he had just read, losing and misplacing objects, and having trouble planning or organizing events. Gopal is a very intelligent man and that has not changed. You will often find him reading an article about the law. However, he finds he cannot learn new things that rely on remembering new information. This can include new words or symbols.</p>

            <p>Gopal notices that he has trouble with online calendars, booking flights, and hotels when he plans his summer holiday. He can work out the way the dates have to be entered into the form, but makes mistakes with the month and day. If only there was a good example or tooltip!
            He also finds that when he is booking a flight, the table with the various lists of airports automatically enters the initials. He finds this is very confusing when he is checking that everything is correct. Finally, Gopal can make sure he has booked the right number of nights for his hotel stay. He knows his arrival time at the airport is a day later than when he left, but it would help to have a calendar with color and clear markings for the days in the week, not just numbers.</p>

            <p>Many web pages now have their own graphic icons and ways of indicating actions that need to be completed. Gopal is having problems searching for information about a care home that might help him in the future. He cannot work out what the various options are when he tries to fill out a form for his requirements. There appear to be a series of small images beside the edit boxes. However, the minute he begins to write in the form the text explanation disappears. He wants the instructions to remain in place above the area where he is writing and for the box to be highlighted when he misses some important sections.</p>

            <p>Gopal likes to surf the web for anything to do with fishing, his favorite hobby. However, he finds the sheer number of items that appear very confusing. Ideally he would like the number of search results to be reduced and perhaps have some way of seeing the items categorized in groups, so that he can work out which services he needs. In this case it might also be helpful to have icons appearing when the groups are listed, so that he can see articles about fly fishing in one section and sea fishing in another. Blocks of text with more white space around them are also helpful, so that he does not have to cope with such a mass of text.</p>

            <p>Gopal can be independent, but often finds unsuitable designs make him require help. For example, when he tries to make a doctor's appointment. He goes to the doctor's web site and clicks on "make an appointment". Then a popup opens asking him for the date. He is distracted by a phone call. When he returns to the screen he is not sure what he was doing. So he does not make the appointment. If a popup has a clear heading he can be reminded of what he was doing, but without this landmark he is just confused.</p>
            <p>Later, Gopal tries calling to make an appointment. Unfortunately, the voice system is automated and asks him to "press 2 to make an appointment". Gopal typically cannot remember the digit, especially while he is processing the options. He usually gets lost in these systems or types the wrong digit. Gopal is reluctant to ask for help and as a result he is not getting the health care he needs.</p>

            <p>Eventually, Gopal moves to a smaller apartment that is easier to take care of. However, this means he is not used to the ICT interfaces for the heating and television system. He tries to turn on the heat. However, the menu item for selecting heat or air conditioning is labeled "mode" which does not mean anything to him. He cannot remember or learn new terms. Gopal cannot use the whole unit because of this one term. This has caused emergencies, such as hypothermia. Gopal now keeps the heating on at the same setting and temperature and will only change it when his helper comes.</p>
            <p>The TV also has an ICT interface with a lot of icons that Gopal does not know. His helper puts an “on/off” sticker next to the button that he can use. However, he still cannot change the channel or change the volume.</p>
            <p>When his microwave broke he bought a new one with controls that were similar to his old one. Because the controls are familiar, Gopal can use the microwave unaided, although he still needs help with the TV and heating.</p>

          <p>Jonathan is a massage therapist with dyscalculia. Although he is very intelligent in other areas, he has trouble working with numbers and needs to count on his fingers to add very basic sums. He struggles with concepts like “greater than” and “less than” and understanding how numbers are related to each other, especially ones that end in a series of zeros such as 10, 100, 1000, etc. It’s hard for him to follow the logic behind mathematical concepts and to do everyday tasks that involve numbers or quantities, like measuring ingredients in a recipe or paying for things in cash.</p>

            <p>Jonathan struggles to understand how much the products in his cart will cost, especially when he is buying items like meat that are priced by weight. It’s also hard for him to know the right quantities to purchase. He often orders far too much or too little when using online shopping carts. It helps him when shopping web sites provide a way to know the size without numbers, such as showing pictures of the actual products or using terms like small, medium, and large. It also helps him to get a warning when he orders a very large quantity of a particular item so he can correct mistakes like ordering six bunches of bananas when he meant to buy one bunch of six bananas. He saves shopping lists that have been successful in terms of ordering the right quantity for each item so that he can re-use the lists on other occasions. He often ends up spending a lot more than he intended to because he is unaware of relative prices. His bank has helped by adding restrictions on the amount
						he can spend online or using his mobile phone. This can be annoying, but has stopped him from overdrawing his account.</p>

            <p>The use of pin numbers and passwords that insist on including a number has always been an issue and most of the time Jonathan uses a secure password application when online. When it comes to the number on the back of his credit card (Card Verification Code) that is always required at the end of a payment exercise, he has to look it up each time, though autofill has helped with completing the rest of the form. Jonathan made sure that what he originally entered and saved in his browser was correct. Too many times he has had to retrace his steps due to typos and not seeing that the entry was incorrect. When he has to return to the form to make corrections, he finds it essential that the corrections needed are clearly highlighted and the instructions provided are helpful. He also feels that it is important that the data he entered previously is not lost, as the more often he types in numbers etc. the more likely he is to make mistakes.</p>

            <p>At work, there are times when Jonathan has to share a spreadsheet with a colleague to ensure that the group’s accounts are in order, suppliers have been correctly invoiced and fees collected. Looking at the massive grid of numbers makes Jonathan anxious and affects his ability to concentrate on specific parts of the spreadsheet. He has found that it helps to use color coding, increased spacing, and larger font sizes to pick out the various elements. He uses a tool for recording his hours where he can press start and stop to see how long he has worked without using math but he is not confident to add hours worked to the spreadsheet himself. He wishes it was integrated into the work spreadsheet. Jonathan will often use the comment feature to add something that he feels his colleague needs to check, rather than making the correction to the spreadsheet himself.</p>

            <p>When Jonathan needs to give a presentation that involves numbers, he plans ahead by saving the document as a PDF or in another format he can use with his text-to-speech application. This tool helps him find out the correct way to pronounce a multi-digit number, like 1540. Sometimes the context is missing making the pronunciation of the text-to-speech unreliable, so he also checks with his partner. He annotates the document with the correct pronunciation.</p>

					<p>Jonathan is interested in reading about climate change, but has trouble understanding charts showing the expected rise in temperature over time. This happens when all the temperatures are shown as numbers. Jonathan finds it much easier when words such as cold, warm, or hot are used with color changes on a drawing to show the problem. </p>
					<p>Jonathan also finds a graph, diagram, or table can be confusing if there is no summary beforehand.  He spends far too long trying to work out what the content means. Jonathan also  likes clear labels or short summaries to help explain the individual parts of the diagram, graph, or table.  Although good use of color and shapes can help when numbers are represented visually, Jonathan finds clear written descriptions easier to understand.</p>

          <p>Kwame was involved in a very serious car crash that left him with some physical, sensory, and cognitive and learning disabilities having sustained a <a href="#dfn-brain-injury" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-brain-injury-7" title="Brain injury including, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired brain injury (ABI), are caused by damage to the brain which can lead to long-term impairment of executive function, memory, learning, coordination, speech, and emotions as well as other physical and sensory impairments">brain injury</a>. He has returned to work. However, he often finds conversations are strained due to difficulties with memory recollection and visual understanding.</p>
          <p>Kwame learnt how to walk, talk, and live life all over again. Medical experts informed him that his greatest chances for recovery would take place within the first 2 years after his injury. After that he may continue to recover, but at a much slower, and incremental rate. His friends and family are amazed by how quickly he has regained his ability to speak, and perform his daily life functions. They are confused by all of the cognitive difficulties he says he is having, despite his ability to articulate and communicate. For example, he often cannot recognize images and faces. He gets disorientated in physical spaces. He often gets lost in rooms, as well as buildings, larger places, documents, and web sites.</p>
          <p>He has returned to his old company as a researcher and is back using applications and the internet throughout his working day.</p>

            <p>Kwame has dexterity difficulties, so he sometimes uses speech recognition to work through web pages and enter text. He finds this method the least tiring of all the possible input options. Although his speech is slow, he is able to control his computer using speech commands and dictation. It is quite easy to use simple commands to control web sites, although there are times when he forgets some of the commands and has to use his cheat sheet. Kwame likes the scroll commands that allow him to read slowly down a page without using any other input device and he often retraces his steps to reread items. However, there can be problems if the forms on the web site are not labeled correctly or if buttons do not have clear names. Kwame has help personalizing some aspects of form completion. However, if an element is inaccessible via the keyboard, he uses the mouse grid to interact with that part of the site. This is a slow process and can be frustrating as Kwame finds he loses concentration.</p>

            <p>Kwame finds there are times when he spells words incorrectly. He appreciates error corrections, word completion, and systems that accept mistakes. He also has problems finding words when he is tired. He welcomes search suggestions, as these are ideas that might be related to his search. However, too many results can cause concern and Kwame admits he really cannot work his way through very long lists that are not broken up with headings and categories.</p>
          </section><section id="kwame-scenario-3-being-confident-that-he-understands-the-content">

            <p>Kwame has difficulty understanding content when it is not explicitly clear, and without any ambiguity whatsoever. He takes a notably longer amount of time to read and process information to be certain that he is interpreting it correctly. His interpretation of information is almost always correct. However, even the slightest bit of ambiguity, or open interpretation creates sticking points that he must read over and over again. He questions every which way until he can assure himself that he understands it correctly. Examples and clear step-by-step instructions can help him have the confidence to complete his task. Simple, clear memorable graphics or large indicators of steps in a process increase Kwame’s understanding, confidence, and orientation in a process. Kwame also prefers larger fonts. Reading smaller text takes up mental energy that isn’t available for trying to understand what is being said.</p>

            <p>Kwame tries to understand the outline of the page and site, so that he does not get lost in the content. Sometimes he dives into the web site, but then he does not know where he is in the content or task. For Kwame to understand the level of importance of content he needs clear and consistent headings in a hierarchical structure. A clear site structure lets him orient himself in the site.</p>

            <p>He values simple, clear graphics that relate to the content and break it up. These help him orient as well as understand and remember the content. He needs icons that emphasize the structure and role of the content. Images that accompany the main text and make it memorable also help.</p>

            <p>Complex presentations of information (images, diagrams, content heavy web pages, etc.) overload Kwame’s cognitive functioning. This shuts his brain down and prevents him from progressing through processes, navigating, systems, and environments. He stops understanding the information presented, at both the micro and macro level. </p>
            <p>Liberal use of white space helps Kwame when there is a considerable amount of content on one page.</p>
            <p>He struggles to keep track of what he is doing in complex tasks. It is important for Kwame to have the steps of tasks clearly presented, and a mechanism like breadcrumbs that helps Kwame keep track of where he is in a task with multiple steps. Kwame appreciates it when tasks are as simple as possible. “It can’t ever be too simple,” he says.</p>

			<p>Kwame struggles to respond quickly to spoken directions when using a mapping program to find his way to a location. Kwame benefits from previewing the directions before he leaves. He finds route changes very difficult to adjust to. He changes the settings so that directions are given using the terms ‘driver’s side’ and ‘passenger’s side’ instead of left and right, and makes sure the route does not change automatically.</p>

            <p>Maria needs to gather specific types of online information for her job. She often has to run through reports about the company on the company’s web site. She is only able to easily read the headlines of web pages. The company’s web site looks fancy, has a modern user interface and a lot of elements that change when you hover the mouse over them. For Maria this site is a total nightmare! She finally finds the link to the data she needs as it appears when she happens to hover over a certain menu item with her mouse. The link is positioned so that she does not notice it at first. She has found that it really helps if important interactive items are placed in the usual menu areas on a screen and the icons are clearly defined and easily recognizable.</p>

            <p>While ordering business cards (a multi-step process), Maria has difficulty remembering information that she enters into previous screens. On the first step she sees content choices that the process expects her to remember in later screens. Additionally, the prolonged mental stress that she experiences while navigating means it is hard for her to make new memories. Processes that require Maria to remember information from one step to another need to give her the information required, at the exact point of use, otherwise she will not be able to complete the process.</p>

            <p>Maria has eye hand coordination difficulties, so precise movements are hard. She often touches the wrong button on her small phone screen. This means she presses the wrong letter or number when typing. With her letter recognition difficulties this also makes typing in codes or text very unreliable. She confuses left and right so she is pressing the off button in place of the volume. In most interactions on her phone she makes some form of mistake, such as loading a new video when she intends to expand the screen of the window she is watching. To use any application successfully it needs to have a consistent back or undo function.</p>

          <p>Sam loved his work as a librarian. He spent his entire life surrounded by books in peaceful places where he could research his love for history. In recent years, he enjoyed using the web to explore how other people around the world saw the history of his own country and the changing views on famous people from the past. Now he is depressed and very frustrated due to a recent stroke. The right side of his body is paralyzed. He also has difficulty having conversations with friends and family due to aphasia. To him this means that some of his words are muddled and his understanding is not always as clear as it has been. Worst of all, he cannot read as fluently as he has in the past. One-handed typing is slow and he finds his word finding abilities often fail him.</p>
<section id="sam-scenario-1-having-well-spaced-text-with-words-that-are-easy-to-pick-out">

            <p>Despite all the difficulties that Sam has with his beloved reading, he is determined to improve and finds that if a web site has no clutter or background imagery he can read the headings. He also finds that if there is adequate spacing and the text is not too complex, he can pick words out and with the help of text-to-speech understand the meaning. He does not like the sound of the synthesized speech, because he finds it distracting having always read silently. However, over time, he is learning to enlarge the fonts and if the page has left justified text with uneven right edges, he can find his way about by the different shapes of each paragraph. As he becomes more confident, he is beginning to use some browser tools and is able to increase the line spacing and change the font style on some of his old favorite online historical documents.</p>

            <p>Sam has to fill in so many online forms to receive benefits due to his disability. They cause immense frustration and feelings of self-doubt due to their lack of clarity. Every time he has to fill in an edit box, the instructions disappear the minute he begins to type and he cannot remember what is required. He often has to refresh the page and start again to see the label in the box. Sam spends so long on the task that the page times out. He has to print it out and get help. This is really upsetting as he wants to be independent and it often reduces him to tears. This is very unlike him, but as the doctor explains, this is linked to his stroke. He also finds it very frustrating when a form requires a particular way of formatting information with no example as to how to complete the action. Worse still is when the error is not clearly explained, making correction even harder. Dates, postal codes, and phone numbers are a particular nightmare.</p>

            <p>The effects of aphasia with acquired dyslexia can be exhausting and confusing but most worrying for Sam is the sense of getting lost on a web page that he thinks he knows. He admits to being nervous when he cannot pick out elements in a page that requires an interaction. Sometimes he dares not click on a button in case he does something wrong or is sent to somewhere without warning. Sam finds this aspect of his web surfing very alarming, as in the past he has been able to navigate with ease. He discovers that the edges of shapes do not appear as clear as they should when people use pale greys. He misses links unless expressly highlighted. If a pop-up window suddenly appears, there are times when he cannot close it to return to the page. Small crosses or “x”s to close popup windows become a nightmare. Sam stresses that the more things happen on a page, the more confused he becomes. He mentions the fact that some sites are easier on his tablet, as then it all seems to flow
						one way. He can just scroll up and down until he feels happy with a decision.</p>

          <p>When text was written in the passive voice or in an academic manner with long complex words Sam struggled to sometimes understand their meaning even if they were in context. He also finds, if he is required to use the same type of language in a form, that he can copy the words as he cannot always spell them. At times he uses the wrong word. When he is able to use an application that enables the text to be read aloud, he can cope if the language is clear and the sentences are kept short. He likes articles that are written in the active tense so he can understand the main ideas straight away.</p>

          <p>Tal has been a student in Israel for the past year. Tal's Fashion Design course is challenging but fun. Tal loves the creative aspect of the diploma where there is more drawing than writing. Tal has moderate dyslexia, resulting in times when it is hard to cope with complex text. Tal sometimes finds it a challenge  working out how words are pronounced when they have many syllables. This can make it hard for Tal to grasp the meaning of some paragraphs. They often have to reread content. Tal has several projects to complete as part of the Fashion Design portfolio requirements. The one that worries Tal most involves a written assignment to research post-war fashions and their impact on today's designs.</p>

            <p>Tal's use of the library catalogue when using the college computers often fails at the first attempt. This happens when Tal cannot remember the login password. Tal keeps putting in talb-61 rather than tald-16 and cannot see the mistakes. The error message on the web page does not help because it announces that the username or password are incorrect. Tal is not sure which one is wrong. Luckily, when Tal is on a family owned laptop, the browser settings allow Tal to save the password and automatically log in.</p>

            <p>Having navigated the online library system, Tal finds a paper about Post-war fashion. Tal downloads it in PDF format. Tal likes to use a text-to-speech application to read the content aloud, but when Tal tries to highlight the text nothing happens. Tal discovers the document is actually an image and yet there is no warning this is the case. Tal cannot find an alternative accessible version of the paper. This means Tal has to use optical character recognition to virtually scan the paper. It is not totally successful leaving Tal with gaps in the information. Tal finds the process makes it even harder to complete the assignment on time. </p>

            <p>Finally, Tal finds an online journal that has another article, but there is a form that has to be completed in order to cite the paper. Tal starts the process, but realizes they do not know the author's name. Tal returns to the web page with the article to copy and paste the name. Sadly, when Tal comes back to the form, all that they filled in is lost. Tal has to retype the whole thing again.</p>

            <p>Tal is a very slow reader and often sounds out words. Tal has impaired auditory processing skills so cannot speed up the text-to-speech application. To manage a busy life, Tal tries to scan and skip through the massive amounts of content, emails, and newsletters to read the key parts. Sometimes however, Tal cannot find important content because it is buried inside lots of other content. The headers and visual layout of the content does not always guide Tal to the information needed. </p>

            <p>This all means that Tal worries about missing something important and sometimes that happens. For example, Tal's daughter's elementary school published a weekly newsletter with interesting stories about activities and important announcements. It contained information that school was ending early one day, but it was buried under less important information about the school activities. Because it takes Tal so long to read each word, they did not manage to read the whole newsletter and did not know that their daughter was coming home earlier than usual. As a result, Tal was not home in time and their daughter was left waiting outside for over an hour.</p> </section><section id="tal-scenario-5-pressing-the-correct-button">

            <p>Tal struggles with impaired eye hand coordination, so precise movements are hard. Tal often touches the wrong button or number when typing on a small phone screen. With Tal's letter recognition difficulties this makes typing in codes or text very unreliable. Tal also confuses left and right so often presses the off button in place of the volume. In most phone interactions, Tal makes some form of mistake. Tal relies on a consistent back or undo function to be able to use an application successfully.</p>

          <p>Yuki found concentrating at school difficult. When she got into college and started taking a course in business studies life became even more stressful. She knew she could cope with the studies, but never seemed to get her work completed on time. She found it hard to start a report and even to create a plan for a project. When working with others she always had good ideas but somehow they were never taken up. She became frustrated, often failing to keep her feelings in check. Luckily, a tutor suggested she look for help. When a psychologist mentioned <a href="#dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-ad-h-d-5" title="Attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or AD(H)D involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted">Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder</a> or AD(H)D, Yuki was relieved to have a reason for her planning and organizational difficulties and other <a href="#dfn-executive-function" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-executive-function-23" title="The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning, fulfilling tasks, and goals">executive functions</a>. She did not want to draw attention to her difficulties, but knowing what caused the challenges helped her find solutions. She learnt that if she could make use of her constantly active brain and body as well as manage her time better, she could turn her hobby into a very successful Yoga business.</p>

            <p>Yuki could not really explain her apparent forgetfulness and not being able to focus or complete tasks. She knew that if she came across a long document or web page with dense text she had to find the key points. If the web page failed to have a clear structure, well-spaced and highlighted headings she would be lost and lose concentration. Yuki also said that if she was reading her mobile screen, advertisements appearing between chunks of text upset her focus and she had to stop reading. However, when there was good use of white space, recognizable icons linking to simple bold text clarifying the important points, Yuki could target these areas and find out what she needed. A clear summary helped Yuki understand and she could remember much of what she had read.</p>

            <p>When setting up a new web site for her yoga business, Yuki found an attractive template with several different ways of being able to show images of her exercises. However, she could not make the carousel of photographs pause, or a banner with her latest news stop scrolling. This really annoyed her, as she found both items stopped her concentrating on the important content on the rest of the site. She thought that if it was upsetting her; what about her intended audience? She had to find a friend to add some code that not only added controls, but also stopped the automatic movement, giving her web site a calmness that she hoped her yoga teaching achieved.</p>

            <p>Yuki enjoyed her yoga teaching. However, she found that if she was developing some instructional materials for her web site, online tools often failed to provide sufficient guidance. Unless there was a clear pathway and a way to return to the place where she was working, she often deleted items by accident or could not make corrections. Saving endless previews with yet more tabs being open in her browser caused anxiety levels to rise. It was not until she found a web application that made each task clear with a submit button, that saved her work in stages, that she was able to cope. Yuki was able to see sections of her work in the correct order and could then manage the bite size chunks of instruction, rather than have to deal with it all at once. This made it so much easier for her to complete the exercise sheets. She became confident in her use of the application to the extent she was willing to purchase the pro version.</p>

            <p>Yuki likes watching instructional videos, but starts to lose focus after a few minutes. It's especially hard for her to concentrate if there is more than a minute of content that she already knows. Sometimes she watches videos at high speed so that they are less boring, but she still quickly loses focus and has trouble locating information she missed. When a video is broken down into segments with clear headings, she can jump to the information she needs to learn. She can also jump forward over segments that she already knows. When she misses information that she needs, she can easily jump to the correct location and focus. If a video transcript is available, she likes to search it for key terms. Watching the video and reading parts of the transcript helps her learn new information.</p>

   <p><strong>Help users understand what things are and how to use them.</strong> Use things that are familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new icons, symbols, terms, or design patterns. People with cognitive and learning disabilities often need common behavior and design patterns. For example, they may know the standard convention for links (underlined and blue for unvisited; purple for visited).

			<p>This Appendix provides guidance and considerations for building a policy or requirements for web content to meet the needs of individuals with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-76" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. Web content designed without consideration for the needs of individuals with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-77" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> often creates accessibility barriers for them.
			</p>

			<h3 id="b-1-why-make-a-policy"><bdi class="secno">B.1 </bdi>Why Make a Policy?<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#why-make-a-policy"></a></h3>
			<p>Many content providers want to reach user groups such as people with <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-15" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a> and millennials with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-78" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. This can be because:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>they have a commitment to inclusion,</li>
				<li>to enable growth in these high value, under-serviced, markets, and</li>
				<li>many services and agencies are required to use easy to understand language and to be usable by vulnerable groups.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Typically, there are many more people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-79" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> in the target audience than  developers are aware of. Without a policy or requirements in place that address <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-80" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>, content providers lose this part of the target audience.</p>
			<p>When deciding how and where to apply this document, consider how important the content is to the user. For example, web content and applications should follow as much of the advice in this document as possible, if they affect:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>individual safety concerns,</li>
				<li>health,</li>
				<li>critical services,</li>
				<li>autonomy,</li>
				<li>care-giving,</li>
				<li>social integration, and</li>
				<li>workplace needs.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>It is also important to consider if content can help users save money in care-giving or cause individuals with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-81" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> to leave the workforce due to lack of appropriately designed content or interfaces.</p>
			<p>Developing of a plan or policy can include the following steps:</p>
					<ol>
					<li><strong>Define the scenarios</strong> to be included in the policy by addressing the environments or situations in which the policy will apply.</li>
					<li><strong>Review the different design pattern criteria and sections</strong> and decide if they are relevant to the environmental or situational scenarios.</li>
					<li><strong>Develop a policy</strong> with requirements based on an analysis of the scenarios.</li>
					</ol>
				<p>Policy makers should:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Familiarize themselves with the sections of the document and design scenarios for which apply to their organizations.</li>
					<li>Determine how much user testing is possible, based on the scope or expense for the affected sites.</li>
					<li>Refer to the section on user testing for additional information and reducing costs.</li>
					</ul>
				<p><strong>The following are examples of scenarios that may be covered by a policy:</strong></p>
					<ul>
					<li>Emergency services content - such as police, fire, emergency medical services, etc.</li>
					<li>Critical services content - such as water, health care, phone and internet services, and government services.</li>
					<li>Workplace content - including but not limited to professional sites and productivity tools.</li>
					<li>Individual content and autonomy - such as apps, interfaces to run home devices, book a cab, write an email; content that facilitates autonomy.</li>
					<li>General content - for widespread adoption of all web sites.</li>
					</ul>

			<p>This document can help you meet the needs of underserved end-users such as:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>high net worth senior citizens, a 7.1 trillion-dollar growth market, and</li>
				<li>high potential impaired by <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-82" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a> and those impacted by situational impairments.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For example, one of the most reliable market projections is that the population is aging. A growing number of consumers are older. In many countries, more of the wealth lies with an older demographic.</p>
				<p>As people age, disabilities increase. This includes <a href="#dfn-age-related-forgetfulness" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-age-related-forgetfulness-16" title="People with age related forgefulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging">age-related forgetfulness</a> and a slower speed of learning new designs. This may make consumers feel excluded and that their needs are not considered. Accessibility can give the consumer the trust and feeling of being looked after. In contrast, if a site is difficult for people with <a href="#dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn" id="ref-for-dfn-cognitive-and-learning-disabilities-83" title="Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations">cognitive and learning disabilities</a>, the older population is likely to feel that the group is not interested in them as a market.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, according to Georgia State University’s Center for Mature Consumer Studies, today’s mature market (those aged 55 and above) already controls 75 percent of America’s wealth and 70 percent (most) of its disposable income. Clearly, this expanding demographic is an important market for many organizations.</p>
				<p>Additional studies have shown that the mature market is online. They may even be outpacing the use by younger user groups, when it comes to adopting new technologies and online media. However, their online needs are underserved. Research suggests that seniors manage to complete only 55.3% (about half) of attempted tasks online.</p>
